/**
 * Fail on the copy habits the reorganisation is removing, and on the one CSS
 * mistake that makes long text render wrong.
 *
 * Two rules, both learned from reading every string in the app:
 *
 * BANNED PHRASES — fourteen empty states ended "appears here", "Talk to your
 * program contact" was printed five times with no name or link, and "Hrs left"
 * broke the unit rule DESIGN.md sets. Each is a habit, not a typo: it comes
 * back the moment someone writes a new empty state from memory.
 *
 * TRUNCATE WITHOUT A WIDTH — `truncate` on a flex child does nothing unless
 * the child can shrink below its content, which needs `min-w-0` (or a fixed
 * `max-w-`). This is why names in table cells were "truncated" and still blew
 * the column open. A className with one and not the other is the bug.
 *
