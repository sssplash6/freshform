/**
 * Every state the product can be in, in one file.
 *
 * Before this existed, a state was re-derived wherever it was needed: 19 free-text
 * `Chip` labels, `flagsFor()` on the program page, the `Deadline` component, three
 * copies of a progress-to-colour map, and `INTERVIEW_STATUS_META`'s labels that
 * told a student "Student can't make it" about themself. The same fact wore
 * different words and different colours depending on which page you were on, and
 * adding a page meant inventing the wording again.
 *
 * So: a state has ONE type, ONE severity, and its wording is a property of the
 * type and the reader — not of the page. A page asks what is true and renders
 * what it is told.
 *
 * THREE RULES that the rest of the design leans on:
 *
 * 1. `severity` is the only thing that picks a colour, and a glyph and a word
 *    always ride along (see `GLYPH`). Nothing is ever colour-only.
 * 2. `now` arrives on `ViewerContext` and is never read from the clock in here.
 *    Every "is it expired" question in the app used to call `Date.now()` during a
 *    render, which is impure and made the answer depend on when a component
 *    happened to paint.
 * 3. `audience` comes from role and lens — never from authority. What a person
 *    may DO is decided by `lib/authz.ts`; this file decides what they are TOLD.
 *    A dual-role admin reading in mentor lens keeps every one of their rights and
 *    simply gets a mentor's wording.
