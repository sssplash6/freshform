 * Pin a floating panel to its trigger in VIEWPORT coordinates, so the panel can

 *
 * Cropping is the whole reason this exists. Panels here sit inside `Panel`
 * (`overflow-hidden`, masking its rounded corners) and `Table`
 * (`overflow-x-auto`, to scroll wide columns — which makes the vertical axis
 * clip too). An absolutely-positioned dropdown inside either is cut off at the
 * container's edge, and no amount of z-index helps: clipping happens before
 * stacking is ever considered. Positioning `fixed` from <body> is the only
 * thing that reliably gets a panel out.
 *
 * Flips above the trigger when there is more room there, clamps to the viewport
 * so an edge-of-screen panel stays fully visible, and re-measures on scroll,
 * resize, and whenever the panel's own size changes (a menu that reveals an
 * edit form has to be re-placed, or it hangs off the bottom).
