 * The one-time email a student gets on joining a program. Three doors lead
 * here, but only two read differently to the person opening the mail:
 *
 * - "enrolled": staff registered them (or an imported record finally got a
 *   real address). They have never seen the app, so the mail says what it is
 *   and how to get in.
 * - "approved": they signed themselves up and an admin let them in. They've
 *   already walked through onboarding, so no tour — just what happens next.
 *
 * Transactional and once per person, so no unsubscribe link: there is no
 * series to opt out of, and it must reach imported students who have the
 * weekly digest switched off.
