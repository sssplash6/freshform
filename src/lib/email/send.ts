 * Swapping provider means rewriting `deliver` and nothing else.
 *
 * NEVER call this from inside a `prisma.$transaction`. Network I/O would hold
 * SQLite's single write lock open, and a transaction that later rolls back would
 * already have sent the mail. Everything here runs from the weekly cron, after
 * its reads are done.
