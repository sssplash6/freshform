/**
 * The URL is the filter state, and this file is the only thing that reads it.
 *
 * Every list in the app had grown its own answer to the same three questions —
 * what does `?program=` mean, what happens to the other params when I change
 * one, and where does the page number go. `mentor-hours-filter.tsx` was the
 * extreme: 322 lines in which the URL contract, the date arithmetic and the
 * pill markup were one inseparable lump, so nothing in it could be tested and
 * nothing in it could be reused. Beside it sat three hand-rolled filter cards
 * (`admin/students`, `mentor/sessions`, and the `SearchForm` shell) that each
 * re-derived a subset of the same rules, and each got a different subset wrong:
 * one dropped the page number, one carried it, one lost the program when you
 * searched.
 *
 * So the reading of the URL lives here, as functions with no I/O, and the
 * drawing of the controls lives in `ui/filter-bar.tsx`. The whole point of the
 * split is that the rules below are provable — `filters.test.ts` is the reason
 * this file imports no `prisma`, reads no clock, and takes `now` as an
 * argument.
 *
 * FOUR RULES the rest of the layer leans on.
 *
 * 1. **Absent and empty are the same thing.** A GET form submits every field it
 *    has, empty ones included, so `?q=&program=` is what the browser produces
 *    the moment someone presses Apply with a blank box. `readParam` collapses
 *    that to "" and every link this file builds drops it again, so the URL
 *    tidies itself on the next click and no reader downstream can tell the
 *    difference.
 * 2. **Changing a filter resets the page.** Page 4 of a one-page result is a
 *    blank screen that looks like data loss, and it was reachable from three
 *    of the four filter cards.
 * 3. **A param may narrow what a viewer sees and never widen it.** Access comes
 *    from `FilterScope`, which is ANDed in unconditionally; the params only
 *    ever add further conditions. A pasted id from another program therefore
 *    returns nothing rather than someone else's rows.
 * 4. **Nothing here throws.** Every value in a URL is typed by a stranger. An
 *    unknown enum, a 40th of February, a `programId` of `constructor` all have
 *    to produce a sane filter or no filter at all.
