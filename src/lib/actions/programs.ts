 * and this is neither: creating a program (which arrives with nobody
 * administering it, so it cannot be anybody's) and `ProgramStaff` writes (which
 * hand out access). Archiving creates and destroys nothing — every grant
 * survives it, every ledger page stays reachable, and the reader who ran the
 * program is the one who knows it has finished. It is also the only reversible
 * door on that settings page, which is the argument for putting it beside the
 * two irreversible ones rather than behind a different person.
 *
