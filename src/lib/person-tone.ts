 *
 * THREE hues, down from eight. Eight was not merely loud — it was ambiguous:
 * a mentor's chip could be the same amber as a "no-show" chip and the same
 * violet as an "in progress" chip, so a reader could not tell whether a colour
 * meant a person or a problem. Three hues that appear nowhere else in the

 * accepted cost: the initials and the name disambiguate, the colour only has to
 * make a column trackable.
 *
 * Class strings are written out in full because Tailwind only generates
 * utilities it can see in source — a template like `bg-tone-${hue}-soft` would
 * compile to nothing.
