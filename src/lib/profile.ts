/**
 * The lens: which half of the app a dual-role person is looking through.
 *
 * Nine of the ten admins also mentor students, so almost everybody on staff is
 * two people at once — one who allocates time and one who delivers it. The
 * switch between them used to be a pair of LINKS into two route trees, which
 * meant switching cost you your place: it needed a map of which page in one
 * tree corresponded to which page in the other, and where the map had no entry
 * you were dropped on a home screen mid-task.
 *
 * A cookie instead. It changes four things and no others:
 *
 *   1. which home `/` resolves to
 *   2. the items in the sidebar
 *   3. the default filter on the lists ("just mine" vs "all in my programs")
 *   4. which action on an entity page is the PRIMARY one
 *
 * What it never changes: what you may do. Authority is `authz.ts`, which reads
 * grants and reach and never reads this cookie — a server action ignores the
 * lens entirely. So a lens can never grant anything, and switching can never
 * take a control away. That is what lets the switch keep you where you are:
 * the page repaints, the URL does not move, and nothing you were mid-way
 * through disappears.
