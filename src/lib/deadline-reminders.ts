 * Deadline reminders: notifies the student AND the mentor once when an
 * allocation's deadline enters the 7-day window, and once more if it passes
 * with hours still unused. `deadlineStage` on the allocation dedupes the
 * sends and is reset whenever an admin changes the deadline. Runs from the
 * daily Render cron (see /api/cron/deadline-reminders), and from nowhere else.
 *
 * It used to run from the three dashboards on page load as a "fallback". That
 * put a write, a scan of every allocation in the school and a fan-out of
 * notifications inside the render of the page three roles open all day — so
 * the cost was paid on every visit, and the notifications went out at whatever
 * moment somebody happened to open a dashboard rather than on a schedule
 * anybody could reason about. A missed cron tick now delays reminders until
 * the next tick, which is what a missed tick should do.
