 * by is rounded and takes a "+", while a figure that IS the record — one
 * allocation, one logged session, a balance a mentor is about to spend
 * against, anything beside money — stays exact through `formatDuration`.
 * `PRODUCT.md` promises these numbers are trusted; that promise lives on the
 * exact side of the line, and this side exists so the exact side is legible
 * when you get to it.
 *
 * It always rounds DOWN, because that is what the "+" claims. Rounding 130h 07m
 * up to "135+ hours" would say the program has time it does not have, and a
 * figure that overstates is worse than a figure that is long.
 *
 * Under an hour there is nothing to round — "45 min" is already the shortest
 * true thing — and under ten hours the hour is precise enough on its own, so
 * the five-hour step only starts where the digits actually stop meaning
 * anything.
