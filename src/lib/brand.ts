/**
 * The palette, once, as values.
 *
 * `globals.css` is the app's source of truth for colour and every component
 * reads it through a Tailwind token. Two consumers cannot: an email client
 * never sees our stylesheet, so `email/layout.ts` must inline real hex, and
 * `docs/guides/generate-guides.cjs` renders PDFs outside the bundle. Both had
 * hand-copied their own hexes, and the guides had drifted to a different ink
 * (#1f2937) and line (#e5e7eb) than the app's.
 *
 * So the hex lives here, and `globals.css` and this file are the two halves of
 * one palette that must be edited together. Keeping them in step by hand is
 * the cost of Tailwind 4's CSS-first tokens; a generated stylesheet would
 * remove it and is not worth the build step for eleven values.
 *
 * Only colours with more than one consumer belong here. A token used solely by
 * components stays in `globals.css`.
