 * twice, so the producer of a notice had to guess which of the two each reader
 * was entitled to, and one session logged sent admins to one address and

 * home by the role gate, having been told something happened and not where.
 *
 * `/students/x` moves that decision to the only place that can make it — the
 * read, where the reader is known (src/app/students/[id]/page.tsx).
 *
 * The member NAMES still say admin/mentor. They are what thirty producers
 * spell, and renaming them is a diff across six action modules that says
 * nothing this comment doesn't; the commit that takes the last role-scoped
 * student page down renames them with its call sites.
