/**
 * Who may see and change what.
 *
 * Until the grants migration this was one question with one answer: `role ===
 * ADMIN` meant every program, every student and every figure in the app. The
 * owner runs three programs and wanted people who administer one of them, so
 * the answer is now a SCOPE — the set of programs a person holds a
 * `ProgramStaff` row for — and every gate in the app is a question about that
 * set rather than about a role.
 *
 * Two rules hold the model up:
 *
 *   1. A role grants NOTHING here. `role = ADMIN` with no rows is a person who
 *      administers no programs, and the pages say so rather than 404ing on
 *      every link. Access is a row somebody made, with their name on it.
 *   2. `platformAdmin` is the only exception, and it is deliberately total:
 *      "ALL" is not a set of every program id but a different answer, so a
 *      program created a second from now is inside it without anybody being
 *      re-granted.
 *
 * The mentor half of the app does not use scope at all — a mentor's reach is
 * their caseload, which `mentorReaches` asks once for everybody.
 *
 * This file answers questions; it never redirects. The gates that do —
 * `requireAdminAccess`, `requireProgramScope` — live in `dal.ts` beside every
 * other gate, which also keeps the session out of here so the model itself can
 * be tested without one.
