/**
 * What this person can reach, as a list of places.
 *
 * This replaces `NAV_BY_ROLE`, a `Record<Role, NavItem[]>`, and the reason is
 * that a static map keyed on a role cannot say the one thing the nav now has to
 * say: access is a GRANT. `role = ADMIN` is a person who administers whichever
 * programs somebody put their name on — three, one, or none — and a constant
 * array has no way to hold "one, and it is called Master's". So the items are
 * derived from the same two questions every gate asks (`adminScope`,
 * `staffLevel`) rather than from a second, parallel idea of who someone is.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because they are the point:
 *
 *   A scoped admin with exactly ONE program sees that program's NAME where a
 *   platform admin sees a list. There is no program switcher anywhere in the
 *   app (§4.3) — a program is an entity and a filter, not a silo — so for the
 *   person who only ever works in one, naming it is the whole of the context
 *   they need.
 *
 *   An admin with NO grants gets a single item. Their inbox is where they are
 *   told they hold nothing, and a sidebar offering them four lists that would
 *   all be empty is a sidebar that argues with the page.
 *
 * The lens (`profile`) chooses between the two staff item sets and nothing
 * else. It cannot add an item — `adminScope` decides that — which is what keeps
 * the switch honest: pressing ⌥M can never reveal a place you could not already
 * go.
