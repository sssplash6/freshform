 * A task is what hours are FOR. An admin names one whenever they grant hours
 * (config/app-config.ts holds the preset list, and anything can be typed in its
 * place), which creates the student's piece of work with that grant as its hour
 * budget. The mentor then logs every session against one of the open tasks they
 * hold for that student, so planned hours and delivered hours line up without
 * anyone reconciling two lists by hand.
 *
 * The model calls these `Assignment` rows — see prisma/schema.prisma. "Task" is
 * the word the team uses, so it is the word the UI uses.
