/**
 * Every rating in the product, at one address, in the shape the reader needs.
 *
 * It replaces `/admin/feedback` and `/mentor/feedback`, which were the same
 * table read twice: one grouped every rating by mentor and named the students
 * who left them, the other listed one mentor's own and named nobody. Two pages,
 * two paginations, two empty states and two definitions of an average.
 *
 * THE PAGE IS ORDERED BY THE WORST AVERAGE, and that is the whole design. It
 * used to be ordered by rating COUNT (`feedback.ts:26`), which put the busiest
 * mentor on top and buried the one with two ratings of 1 — the only mentor
 * anybody has ever opened this page to find.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THE OLD PAGES LET A READER SEE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT, all closed
 * here:
 *
 *   1. A rating OF YOU carried the name of the student who left it. The form
 *      says "Your name isn't shown to the mentor", and nine of the ten admins
 *      also mentor students (`profile.ts`), so for nine of ten mentors that
 *      promise was false: they opened /admin/feedback and read exactly who had
 *      scored them 2. Withheld below, by the reader's own id, in both shapes.
 *   2. The mentor picker read `mentorFeedback: { some: {} }` — every mentor
 *      rated anywhere, by name and email, offered to a leader granted one
 *      program. It reads through the reader's own scope now.
 *   3. Website ratings were fetched with no scope at all and rendered with the
 *      student's name and email beside each comment. That table is gone (M5).
 *
 * And SALES no longer reaches this page. `requireAdminAccess` admits any
 * non-empty scope, so a salesperson who typed /admin/feedback was let in and
 * read their program's comments; the nav merely did not link it. Owner
 * decision 5 gives feedback to LEADER and ADMIN grants, and `readablePrograms`
 * below is that sentence.
