/**
 * Every program this reader administers, and which of them is asking for
 * something.
 *
 * There was no index before: the only way into a program was a row on the admin
 * dashboard, under a banner, a stat strip and an editable session log
 * (`admin/page.tsx:77-200`). What stood in for one on the two pages that had a
 * grid was `ProgramIslandCard` — a 3D-tilting card in the program's own hue,
 * carrying a monogram, a meter and three of its own stats. §6.11 keeps the
 * numbers and drops the furniture: a row per program, five figures, no hue.
 *
 * A ONE-PROGRAM ADMIN NEVER SEES THIS PAGE. Their whole scope is one entity, so
 * an index of one is a click that tells them what they already knew — the same
 * rule the sidebar follows when it collapses "Programs" to the program's own
 * name (`lib/nav.ts:98-110`).
