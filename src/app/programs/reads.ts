/**
 * The reads every program page shares, each asked once per request.
 *
 * §6.12 names this as a defect rather than a nicety: the layout ran
 * `program.findUnique` + `studentsWithHours` (`admin/programs/[id]/layout.tsx:26-42`)
 * and the page under it ran the identical pair (`page.tsx:97-107`), so opening a
 * program paid for both twice — and the two could disagree, because each called
 * the clock for itself and forfeiture is judged against a moment. `cache()`
 * makes the layout's call and the page's call the same call, with the same
 * answer.
 *
 * The derivation at the bottom is shared for the same reason. `/programs` prints
 * a per-program attention COUNT and `/programs/[id]` prints the ROWS behind it;
 * two derivations would be two chances for the count to disagree with the list
 * it promises.

 * id and touches the database not at all.
 *
 * It is NOT the inbox's "Needs you" narrowed to one program, and the two are
 * labelled differently — "Attention" here, "Needs you" there — so that nobody
 * reads them as the same number. The inbox asks about the whole school and
 * counts meetings and tasks; this asks about one program and counts its
 * pairings, which the inbox deliberately leaves untagged because a mentor works
 * across several.
 *
 * MENTOR ROWS ARE THIS PROGRAM'S PAIRINGS, and nothing wider. `programCount: 1`
 * is a fact, not a guess: they are paired here, so "not in any program" cannot
 * be true of them from where this page is standing. Ratings are deliberately
 * not fetched — an average is a fact about a mentor across every program they
 * teach in, so a program page claiming one would be a different number from the
 * one on their own page, computed from a subset.
