/**
 * The roster, with the program fixed.
 *
 * It is `/students` (§6.8) and not a second table: the page this replaces
 * reimplemented `ProgramStudentsIsland` line for line, with its own columns,
 * its own totals and no filters at all, so a program of two hundred students
 * was two hundred rows and no way to find one of them.
 *
 * The Program filter is the only thing hidden. Everything else — the search,
 * the presets, the paging — is the same bar over the same `where`, and the
 * program is a scope rather than a param: a `?program=` from somewhere else
 * ANDs against it and so can only narrow, never widen (`lib/filters.ts`, rule 3).
 *
 * This is where leaders and sales add students, so the fold sits above the list
 * — reading it is the common visit and adding to it the occasional one.
