/**
 * The shell all three program tabs share: who this program is, one line of what
 * it holds, and the split into what it looks like (Overview), who is in it
 * (Students) and how it is set up (Settings).
 *
 * A layout rather than a header each page renders, so switching tabs leaves the
 * title and the tab strip exactly where they are. It re-runs when an action
 * revalidates, which is what keeps the counts honest.
 *
 * WHAT WENT: the program-hue banner and the 104px ghost monogram behind the
 * title, and the four-to-six `StatCard` strip on the overview under it, which
 * printed the same three numbers this one line does (§6.12).
 *
 * The gear is in the tab strip and NOT also in the actions cluster. §6.12 asks
 * for both; they would have sat one row apart, both reading "⚙ Settings" and
 * both going to the same page. The word is with the gear, which is the part the
 * owner asked for.
