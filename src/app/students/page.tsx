/**
 * The roster, at one address, for everyone entitled to a roster.
 *
 * There were two of these — an admin's list of everybody and a mentor's list
 * of their own — which is one query written twice and two tables to keep in
 * step. It is one page now, and who is reading changes exactly two things:
 * which rows the query may return, and which preset is on when you arrive.
 *
 * A mentor arrives with "Mine" applied. It is a preset and not a hard filter
 * on purpose: a mentor asked to cover for a colleague can clear it and find
 * the student, which is a thing that happens and which a hard filter turns
 * into asking an admin. What they may SEE is decided by reach, not by the
 * chip — `studentsWhere` ANDs the mentor's own reach in underneath.
 *
 * Every narrowing is a `where`. The program filter used to be a JS `.filter()`
 * over every student in the school, so the cost of showing one program was the
 * cost of loading all of them.
