/**
 * Open notification <id>: mark it read, then send the reader where it points.

 * in a tab and keep reading" is the normal way anyone works through a list.
 *
 * It is also what keeps a link written months ago pointing at something. Stored
 * hrefs are never rewritten, so a July row still says `/admin/students/abc`;
 * `neutralHref` turns that into `/students/abc` and the student page decides
 * from there which view this particular reader is entitled to. The same row
 * therefore lands an admin, that student's mentor, and the student herself in
 * three different places, all of them correct.
 *
 * MARKING READ ON A GET is normally the wrong shape, and is right here: the
 * request IS the click that reads the notice, it is idempotent, and it changes
 * nothing else. A prefetch cannot trip it either — these rows are plain
 * anchors, not <Link>.
