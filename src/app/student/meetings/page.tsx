/**
 * A student's meetings, ahead and behind.
 *
 * This page is why the home page could get short. `StudentJourney` put thirteen
 * unpaginated past sessions — about 1,200px — under everything a student
 * actually opens the app for, and removing it from the home left the history
 * with nowhere to be: the component was orphaned and a student could no longer
 * see a single past session anywhere in the app.
 *
 * Two lists, because "still to come" and "already happened" are two different
 * questions and only one of them has anything to answer. Coming up carries the
 * answer buttons; the past is a read-only rail.
