/**
 * Everything about you, in one place, whoever you are.
 *
 * These controls existed — scattered. The name and picture forms were on the
 * mentor's own profile page and gated on `canActAsMentor`, so a student could
 * not fix the spelling of their own name and an admin who does not mentor
 * could not have a picture. Booking links were a fold on the mentor home,
 * where they competed with the caseload. The weekly-email toggle was at the
 * bottom of the notification feed, which is a list of things that happened,
 * not a place anybody looks for a preference. A Telegram handle was captured
 * once at onboarding and never editable at all.
 *
 * Sections appear only when they are yours: a student has no booking links, a
 * mentor has no Telegram row.
