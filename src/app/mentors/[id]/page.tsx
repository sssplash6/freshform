 *
 * It replaces two pages joined by a "View profile" button — /admin/mentors/[id]
 * carried the whole delivery record and none of the identity, /mentors/[id]
 * carried the identity and, by its own comment, "deliberately NO hours" — so an
 * admin looking at a mentor had to know which of two addresses held the fact
 * they wanted.
 *
 * THE GATE RUNS BEFORE ANY QUERY ABOUT THE MENTOR. `requireUser` first, the
 * mentor's existence second, and the reach question third; a page that gated
 * after fetching was a live data leak on Sep 3 2026.
 *
 * Reach is `canManageMentor`: at least one program in common between this
 * reader's grants and this mentor's pairings. Everything the record then shows
 * is filtered to those same programs — a mentor's other programs are not this
 * reader's to read, which is the leak that was fixed on the mentors LIST last
 * week and would otherwise have been reintroduced here one page later.
