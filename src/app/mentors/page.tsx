/**
 * Every mentor the reader administers.
 *
 * The page it replaces opened with an orange "Awaiting assignment" box, then an
 * always-open registration form, then the list — so two thirds of the first
 * screen were about mentors who were not on it, and the list itself was a stack
 * of cards each carrying a collapsed edit form. Registering is now a fold, and
 * everything you might do to one mentor happens on that mentor's page.
 *
 * SCOPE IS THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS. `mentorsWhere` ANDs the reader's
 * grants in ahead of anything the URL says, and the pairing read below carries
 * the same filter: a mentor may work in three programs and be this reader's
 * colleague in one, and the other two are not theirs to read.
 *
 * One consequence worth stating, because the old page did the opposite: a
 * mentor with NO pairing at all — a fresh sign-in waiting to be placed — is in
 * no program, so a scoped admin's list cannot contain them and only a platform
 * admin sees them under the Unassigned chip. That is `canManageMentor`'s rule
 * ("a mentor who is paired with nothing is nobody's to edit but a platform
 * admin's"), and the box this page used to carry ignored it: it listed every
 * unregistered sign-in to every admin, whatever they had been granted.
