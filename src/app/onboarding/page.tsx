 * student cannot open the mentor form and a mentor cannot open the program
 * picker, and neither can be linked into the other's step by accident.
 *
 * The fourth branch — awaiting approval — is the wall that used to stand on
 * `/student`. It belongs here: everything else on that home is about time a
 * PENDING student does not have yet, `/student/book` turns them away, and the
 * page they were sent to had one row on it saying so. The step says the same
 * sentence in the place where nothing else is competing with it.
