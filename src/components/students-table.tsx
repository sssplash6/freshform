/**
 * The roster, in six columns.
 *
 * It had eight, and two of them — Telegram and Folder — were an em-dash in
 * most rows, so they cost a phone two columns of width to say nothing. They
 * are one Contact cell. `Program` survives, because this list is reached
 * without one as often as with one; `Cohort` folds into it as a muted suffix,
 * since programs are flat by default and the column was empty in all three.
 *
 * The bigger change is what the numbers say. Allotted / Completed / Missed /
 * Remaining was four right-aligned figures the reader had to subtract in their
 * head, and the set was incomplete in the one way that matters: it omitted
 * FORFEITED, so a student at zero because their time expired was indis-
 * tinguishable from one who used every minute of it. One "Left" column now,
 * with the total muted beside it, and the chip beside the name says which of
 * the two happened.
 *
 * "Last session" is the column no total can replace: a student can hold plenty
 * of time and not have been seen for six weeks, and that is the thing worth
 * finding on a list.
