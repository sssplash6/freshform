/**
 * The two "open something new" folds.

 * Both were hand-rolled `useState` toggles in this one file, and in two
 * different shapes: a secondary `Button` that swapped itself for a form, and a
 * bare "+ Add a cohort to this program" text link that did the same thing
 * without a chevron, a focus ring or a name a screen reader could announce.
 * `ui/disclosure.tsx` exists because of these two — see the list in its header
 * — and it brings the thing neither had: a closed `<details>` still expands
 * when a browser finds text inside it.
