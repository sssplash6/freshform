/**
 * The two writes an admin makes about a mentor: register one, and change where
 * they work.
 *
 * They were `create-mentor-form.tsx` and the edit half of `mentor-list.tsx`,
 * and what was wrong with the second is where it lived rather than what it did.
 * It was an inline editor on EVERY row of the mentors list, so a page of
 * twenty-five mentors mounted twenty-five `ProgramTargetsPicker`s over the same
 * program list — the N+1 §6.10 names — and the list, which is a place to scan,
 * was also the only place to edit. Editing a mentor is a thing you do to ONE
 * mentor, so it happens on that mentor's own page.
 *
 * REDESIGN.md §5.2 files both of these under `forms/people-forms.tsx`, together
 * with the student halves. That merge cannot land here: its rule is that a file
 * merge only lands in the commit that rewrites its call sites, and the student
 * forms' call sites belong to commits 40 and 41.

 * whoever can point another admin's login at a mailbox they own can become
 * them. The two fields are still POSTED when they are read-only — the action
 * asks whether they MOVED, not whether they were submitted, so a locked field
 * that sends its current value is a save with no identity change in it.
 *
 * `programs` is the reader's own program list, which is what makes the unticked
 * boxes safe to read as removals: a pairing in a program they do not hold draws
 * no row here, and the action refuses to delete what drew no row.
