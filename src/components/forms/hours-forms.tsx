 * that pool and is what a session is logged against. The link is literal —
 * raising an allocation opens the same `TaskPicker` the task menu edits, so the
 * arriving hours name the work they are for — and removing an allocation
 * deletes that mentor's tasks with the student along with it. Splitting them
 * would put two ends of one write in two files.

 * the student entirely.
 *
 * A correction that raises the total is still a grant, so the task picker
 * appears the moment the typed hours go above what the student already holds.
