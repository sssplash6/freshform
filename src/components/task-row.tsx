/**
 * One piece of planned work, wherever it appears.
 *
 * Four renderers drew this row, and the two on the student's own page drew it
 * twice on one screen: `AssignmentsPanel`'s seven-column table and
 * `LedgerBoard.TaskRow` rendered the same task at the same time, and disagreed
 * about it — over budget was amber in the table and red in the board, "Done"
 * was a green wash in one and a grey wash in the other. `StudentGoals` drew a
 * third version as a card, and the program page a fourth as a table missing the
 * budget bar. Three of the four kept their own progress-to-colour map.
 *
 * Two rules settle all of that, and neither is this file's to choose:
 *
 * OVER BUDGET IS DANGER, EVERYWHERE. Overspend on a task is a problem with the
 * plan, not a nudge, and `TASK_OVER_BUDGET` is `severity: "problem"` — so the
 * number, the chip and the meter all take red, on every page. The row asks
 * `taskStatuses` whether it is over rather than comparing the two numbers
 * itself, which is also why a student — who is never told about a budget — sees
 * no red they cannot read an explanation for.
 *
 * DONE IS A ✓ CHIP WITH NO WASH. A tinted row is a colour with no words, it
 * fought the row's own status chip, and it spent a background on the one state
 * nobody needs to find. Progress stays a shape — ○ ◐ ✓ from
 * `ASSIGNMENT_PROGRESS_GLYPH` — on a neutral chip.
 *
 *   table  the plan as a ledger — a student's page, a program's page
 *   list   the plan read forward: purpose, whose it is, a budget meter
 *   line   the settled subset, one line each, behind a "Finished · 6 ▸" fold
