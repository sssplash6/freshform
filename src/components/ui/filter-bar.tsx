/**
 * One bar above every list: what you are looking for, and what the list is
 * showing you now.
 *
 * It replaces four things that did this job in four shapes.
 * `mentor-hours-filter.tsx` was 322 lines in which the URL contract, the date
 * arithmetic and the markup were a single lump — two rows of link-pills, a
 * nested `<details>`, its own second `<form>`, and a hand-rolled
 * preset/custom/all state machine, none of it reachable by a test. Beside it,
 * `ui/search-form.tsx` and the hand-rolled cards on `/admin/students` and
 * `/mentor/sessions` each re-derived a subset of the same rules and each got a
 * different piece wrong: one lost the program when you searched, one carried
 * the page number into a new filter, one filtered in JavaScript over every row
 * in the school.
 *
 * So the rules moved to `lib/filters.ts`, which is provable, and what is left
 * here is only the drawing. This file computes no dates, decides no
 * precedence, and invents no words.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF CONTROL, and the difference is the reason the bar is legible.
 *
 * A **value** — the search box, a select, a date — is something you compose,
 * so it lives in one GET form with one Apply. A phone keyboard makes three
 * separate submits for three fields intolerable, and a select that navigated on
 * change would fire a page load in the middle of typing a name.
 *
 * A **chip** is a single fact you either want or do not, so it is a plain link
 * that acts on one click. Chips are `brand-soft` when lit and never orange:
 * orange is hours, and a lit filter is chrome.
 *
 * Both write the same URL, so a filtered list is a link a person can send, the
 * back button steps through filters, and every narrowing is in the query rather
 * than in a pass over rows already fetched.
 *
 * ONE ROW BEFORE THE FOLD, at every width. Laid out flat, the feedback bar's
 * five controls stand 440px tall on a 390px screen — the whole phone, spent
 * before the first rated mentor. So only the search box and Apply are always
 * up: the selects and the date range live behind a `Disclosure` that names
 * them ("Mentor, program, rating and dates") and opens itself whenever one of
 * them is set, which is every filtered URL a person arrives on or lands on
 * after pressing Apply. Not a breakpoint, because the admin reads this on a
 * phone too and a control that moves between widths cannot be described to
 * someone over the phone.
 *
 * The chips stay out in the open. They are one tap for the narrowing a reader
 * most often wants, and folding away the cheap control to save the room the
 * expensive one wastes would be the wrong half.
