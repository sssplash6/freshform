/**
 * The menu on one row: correct it, move it, call it off, remove it.
 *
 * Four files built this same control and then drifted. `allocation-`,
 * `assignment-`, `interview-` and `session-row-actions.tsx` each opened with
 * the identical block — two refs, `useAnchoredPosition({ align: "end" })`, a
 * `close` that also reset every confirm flag, and a mousedown-plus-Escape
 * effect keyed on `[open]` — copied to the character across roughly seventy
 * lines. Everything below that line was the row's own business; everything
 * above it was one component that had not been written yet.
 *
 * Copying it four times cost the usual things. Two of the four render a ⋮ and
 * two a widening pencil, which is a defensible distinction that nothing
 * recorded, so it was a coin toss which a new row got. All four sized the
 * trigger at 32px, under the 44px a thumb needs, on pages students and mentors
 * open on a phone. And none of the four had a keyboard contract at all: no
 * `aria-haspopup`, no `aria-controls`, focus neither contained nor returned.
 * Fixing that in one place is the point of the merge; fixing it in four was
 * why it stayed broken.
 *
 * The confirm flags went with the copies. A destructive step is `ConfirmInline`
 * now, and it resets itself for free: the panel only exists while it is open,
 * so closing the menu unmounts the confirm rather than remembering to clear it.
 *
 * The panel is portaled — see `lib/use-anchored-position.ts` for why it has to
 * be, and note the second thing that buys, since every one of these menus
 * holds a form: a portal is not a DOM descendant of the page, so a form in
 * here is not nested inside the form the page already has. That is illegal
 * HTML, and the browser resolves it by silently dropping the inner form's
 * fields. The four copies depended on this without saying so.
