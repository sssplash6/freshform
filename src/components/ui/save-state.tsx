 * it printed a success message or an error and had no word for "in flight" or
 * "you have typed something and not saved it". Forty call sites shared it, and
 * every one of them that wanted to say more said it by hand — the mentor list
 * disabled its own Cancel button off a separate `pending`, the schedule form
 * kept its own copy of the last result so a collapsed panel could still show
 * it. One set of states, derived once, is what stops that recurring.
 *
 * `at` is optional because a surface that keeps its own result rather than a
 * `useActionState` one (the avatar picker, which is a file input and not a
 * form) has no dispatch to stamp. The tick still lands; only the clock is
 * missing.

 * should not spend one on the expected outcome.
 *
 * `saving` and `editing` render nothing, and that is deliberate. Every save in
 * this app is started by a `SubmitButton`, which already swaps to its pending
 * text and spins while the action is in flight; a second "Saving…" underneath
 * is the same fact twice, and it makes the form jump for the ~200ms it is
 * true. What `saving` does do is clear the previous tick or error, so a stale
 * "✓ Saved 12:04" can never sit under a save that is still going.
 *
 * Both live regions are mounted from the start, empty. A region that appears
 * at the same moment as its text is not reliably announced — several screen
 * readers only watch regions that were already there — which is why the old
 * component's `role="status"` was announced inconsistently. The `rise-in` moves
 * to the inner span, which is the thing that actually mounts.
