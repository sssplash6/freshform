 * The two kinds of link, so the reader can tell them apart before clicking.
 *
 * `ArrowLink` goes somewhere else in this app: arrow points right, and it
 * slides on hover. `ExternalLink` leaves: arrow points up-right and the tab is
 * new. That distinction was being made by hand in nine places, three of which
 * had grown into their own components — `arrow-link.tsx`, `telegram-handle.tsx`
 * and `student-folder-link.tsx`, the last two identical but for their icon and
 * label.
 *
 * Anywhere the app previously printed a literal "→" as text, use `ArrowLink`.
 * A glyph in a sentence is not a link and cannot be tabbed to.
