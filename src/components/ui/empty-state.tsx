/**
 * Nothing here — and why.
 *
 * Structured rather than free-form, because the free-form version produced the
 * same non-answer fourteen times: an empty state that ends "…and it appears
 * here once it's booked" tells the reader where a thing WILL be, which they can
 * see, instead of why it is not there yet, which they cannot.
 *
 * So: `title` names what is absent, `children` says why in one clause, and the
 * `variant` decides whether that absence is normal.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `action` slot. Every empty state that carried a
 * button was a page teaching its own layout — "log a session at the bottom of
 * this page and it appears here" — and pointing at a form that is either
 * already on screen or belongs somewhere else entirely. An empty state
 * explains; the page's own primary action acts.
