 * were six implementations of the same thing, and they disagreed about the
 * details that matter: three heights, two focus treatments, and only two of
 * the six explained the consequence of the option you had picked.
 *
 * Two shapes, because there are genuinely two jobs:
 *
 *   SegmentedRadio  a form field — one of N, submitted with the form
 *   TabLinks        navigation — one of N, each its own URL
 *
 * They look alike on purpose. They are the same gesture; only the consequence
 * differs, and conflating a filter with a form field is how a "filter" ends up
 * inside a `<form>` that submits it as data.

 * program happened to have the longest id. An item matches when its path
