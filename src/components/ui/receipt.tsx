/**
 * What just happened, replacing the form that did it.
 *
 * The inline version was one line of text under a form that had already
 * cleared itself, which left a mentor on a phone unsure whether the tap
 * registered, scrolling up to check. A receipt takes the form's place: it
 * states the outcome, its consequences, and the three things anyone wants next
 * — fix it, do it again, go look at it.
 *
 * "Correct" comes first on purpose. The moment a mentor reads "90 min" and
 * meant 60 is the moment they can still fix it in one tap, and burying that
 * behind a trip to the student's page is how a wrong number becomes permanent.
