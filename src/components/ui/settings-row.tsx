 * One labelled setting: what it is, what it is for, the control, and what that
 * control last did.
 *
 * Five surfaces built this by hand and none of them agreed. The name field, the
 * booking links, the student folder and the program rename each wrote their own
 * `flex flex-wrap items-end gap-2` around a bare `<span className="text-muted-fg">`
 * for a label, and the digest toggle wrote a sixth. Two of the five put their
 * help text above the field and three below; two labelled the input properly
 * and two left it to a placeholder.
 *
 * The description sits UNDER the label rather than under the control, because a
 * sentence explaining what a field does is worth least once the field is
 * already filled in and read.
 *
 * `state` is the row's own `SaveState`. Every row saves independently (§5.8),
 * so the indicator belongs to the row and never to the page.
