/**
 * A panel anchored to the control that opened it — a menu, an account card, a
 * correction form on one table row.
 *
 * Three mechanisms did this job before, and each got a different subset of it
 * right. Two hand-styled `<details>` in `app-shell.tsx`, which is a disclosure
 * pressed into service as a menu: it never closes when you click the page
 * behind it, it never closes on Escape, and its `absolute` panel is cropped by
 * the first ancestor that hides overflow. A per-file portal copied into four
 * `*-row-actions.tsx` files, seventeen identical lines of
 * outside-click-and-Escape apiece. And `select.tsx`, which is the only one of
 * the three that thought about a keyboard.
 *
 * What the four copies all missed is the same three things, and they are the
 * reason this file exists rather than a shared `useDismiss` hook:
 *
 *   Focus never came back. Escape closed the panel and left focus on a node
 *   that had just been unmounted, which puts it on <body> — so the next Tab
 *   started from the top of the page, not from the row you were working on.
 *
 *   Focus was never contained. The panel is portaled to the end of <body>, so
 *   tabbing off its last field did not return to the table: it ran out of the
 *   document entirely, into the browser's own chrome.
 *
 *   The trigger claimed nothing. `aria-expanded` with no `aria-haspopup` and no
 *   `aria-controls` announces as "button, expanded" — expanded into what is
 *   left for the reader to guess.
 *
 * `contents` picks which ARIA shape the panel takes, and it is not decoration.
 * `"actions"` is a real `role="menu"`, which is right for a list of things to
 * do and wrong for anything else: a menu puts assistive tech into application
 * mode, where a text field inside it stops behaving like a text field. Every
 * one of the four row menus holds a form, so those are `"fields"` — a
 * non-modal `role="dialog"`, which keeps forms working and still gets a name
 * announced when focus enters. The interaction is identical either way; only
 * the announcement differs.
 *
 * Dismissal is deliberately quiet: no backdrop, no scroll lock, nothing behind
 * it inert. This is a menu, not a modal — the page underneath stays readable
 * and clickable, and clicking it is how you close this.
