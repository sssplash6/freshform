/**
 * Page and section chrome: one treatment each, no tones.
 *
 * What this replaces was a system where a region's colour said who owned its
 * data — amber for what mentors logged, violet for what admins planned, blue
 * for what was derived — carried over from the spreadsheet these pages
 * replaced. It was a defensible idea that did not survive contact with a real
 * screen: the student home stacked violet, amber, violet and blue panels under
 * an orange hero, and a mentor's identity chip could be the same amber as the
 * panel behind it. The eyebrow already says who owns the region in words, so
 * the tint was saying it a second time in a language with four words in it.
 *
 * Hierarchy now comes from weight, size and space, per DESIGN.md's own rule:
 * use a rule and whitespace before reaching for a container.
