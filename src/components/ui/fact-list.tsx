 * The student page carried three panels of them — corrections, folder, details
 * — each a `<form>` with a Save button per field, so reading a student's email
 * meant reading it out of an `<input>`. A fact is text until someone asks to
 * change it; only then does a control appear.
 *
 * `<dl>` with a wrapper `<div>` per row is the shape the HTML spec added
 * exactly for this: it keeps each label bound to its own value when the rows
 * stack, which a flat run of `<dt>`/`<dd>` does not.
