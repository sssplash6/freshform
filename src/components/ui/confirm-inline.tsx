/**
 * A destructive action and the question it has to answer first.
 *
 * Eight of these were written by hand, and they are eight because the shape
 * kept being re-derived rather than reached for: `DangerButton` in
 * `program-settings-forms.tsx` (itself used three times), the void and the
 * delete on a session row, the removals on an allocation row, an assignment
 * row and a student's Corrections panel, the cancel on a meeting row, and
 * `remove-assignment-button.tsx`, a whole file for one of them.
 *
 * They agreed on the idea and on nothing else. Three visual shapes for the
 * first step — an outlined red button, a red text link, a `Button
 * variant="danger"`. Two for the second, since `remove-assignment-button` kept
 * its confirm outlined while every other one filled it. One asked no question
 * at all: `assignment-row-actions` went straight from "Remove" to "Yes,
 * remove", which is a two-step confirm with the step that carries the
 * information left out. Two disabled Cancel while the action was in flight and
 * six did not. And none of the eight moved focus, so a keyboard user pressed
 * Enter on "Remove", watched the button under their finger become a different
 * button, and had to go and find it again.
 *
 * The second step is filled red. It looks like the primary action because by
 * then it is the primary action — the reader has been asked, and this is the
 * answer they came for. `Button`'s `dangerSolid` exists for exactly this half.
 *
 * The confirm button takes focus when it appears and is described by the
 * question, so a screen reader announces the consequence together with the
 * button that causes it. Escape steps back rather than committing, and it
 * claims the key: inside a `RowActionMenu`, backing out of a confirm must not
 * also close the menu the confirm was in.
 *
 * This owns its own `<form>`, which is what lets `SubmitButton` read the
 * pending state — so it can never be rendered inside another form. Inside a
 * `RowActionMenu` that is already true, because the panel is portaled out of
 * the page's DOM.
