/**
 * One number, with its label.
 *
 * Replaces 57 hand-assembled `StatCard`s across ten files, whose real problem
 * was not the component but the habit: nine pages opened with a strip of four
 * to seven equally-weighted figures, so the eye had to read all of them to find
 * the one that mattered. PRODUCT.md's first anti-reference is "stat-tile grids".
 *
 * Two rules the design depends on:
 *
 * ONE `lead` PER PAGE. The lead is the figure the page exists to show — hours
 * remaining, on a page about a balance. Everything else is `normal` and
 * quieter. A strip where every number is the same size has no hierarchy, which
 * is the same as having no lead at all.
 *
 * `hours` IS THE ONLY COLOURED TONE, and it is the orange that means hours
 * throughout the app. It is deliberately restricted to figures of 24px and up:
 * #f18d05 on white is 2.46:1, which the owner has accepted for large readouts
 * as brand fidelity and which is genuinely unreadable at 13px.
