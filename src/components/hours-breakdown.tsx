 * into delivered, hours charged for meetings missed, hours lost to a
 * deadline, and hours still there. Reading those four out of a strip of stat
 * cards meant holding four figures at once and subtracting; as segments of one
 * bar the proportions are the answer.
 *
 * Extra hours sit OUTSIDE the bar on purpose. They were delivered but charged
 * to nobody, so putting them inside an allotment they were never part of would
 * make the bar lie about what was bought.
