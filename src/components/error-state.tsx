 * What a route shows when its render threw. The framework's own error page says

 * not stuck — they can retry the segment (most failures here are a database read
 * that can simply be tried again), or step back to a page that works.
 *
 * `digest` is printed deliberately: production errors reach the client stripped
 * of their message, and that hash is the only thing that ties what a person saw
 * to the line in the server log.
