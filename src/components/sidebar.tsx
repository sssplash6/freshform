 * The staff column at ≥ lg: 220px, fixed, labelled.
 *
 * It replaces a horizontal bar that had run out of room by its own admission —
 * "Four things do not fit a 320px row" was a comment in the file it replaces —
 * and that had no entry at all for Programs, Sessions or Notifications. A
 * vertical column is not a style choice: items here are added by a grant, so
 * the number of them is data, and a row that overflows at six is the wrong
 * container for a list whose length nobody controls.
 *
 * 220px against a `max-w-6xl` page, which is the reason the main column widened
 * from 5xl in the same commit: the rail has to come out of the window's margins
 * rather than out of the table beside it.
