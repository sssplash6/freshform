/**
 * A logged session, wherever one appears.
 *
 * Four renderers drew this row before: the `MeetingsLog` table (mounted on six
 * routes), `LedgerBoard.LoggedMeetingRow`, `StudentJourney`'s rail, and the
 * inline table on `/mentor/sessions`. They agreed on nothing that mattered.
 * The same voided session was 45% opaque in one, 50% in the second and 55% in
 * the third; the same 90 minutes were bold ink in the table and orange in the
 * two lists; and each of the four re-derived its own chips — three off
 * `ATTENDANCE_META` plus a hand-written "Voided, time returned", and
 * `StudentJourney` off a fourth set written out inline in the student's voice.
 * Two vocabularies for one fact, kept in step by hand: the day somebody edits
 * `ATTENDANCE_META`, the student's page keeps saying the old thing.
 *
 * The shape differs by where the row is read; the facts never do. So one
 * component with three variants, and no variant chooses a word or a colour:
 * `sessionStatuses` supplies both, already in this reader's voice. A plain
 * attended in-plan session gets NO chip, which is what finally removes the
 * green "Logged" badge that sat on every row of every log.
 *
 *   table     the ledger — /sessions, a student's page, a program's page
 *   timeline  a student reading their own history: mentor leads, date is a
 *             marker down a rail (the one thing StudentJourney had right)
 *   line      one sentence, read-only: "Aug 30 · Malika logged 90 min…"
