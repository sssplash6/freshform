/**
 * The shell for a reader who has nowhere to go yet: a wordmark, and a way out.
 *
 * It wraps the sign-in page and the three states where the app is still
 * deciding who somebody is — a self-signed-up student waiting for approval, a
 * mentor waiting to be placed in a program, and anyone part-way through
 * onboarding.
 *
 * No nav, and that is the whole point. Every one of those readers has exactly
 * one page they are allowed to be on, so a nav bar here is four links that
 * bounce them straight back to where they already are; `book/page.tsx` had a
 * "Back to your hours" link that did precisely that. A shell that offers
 * nothing is a smaller lie than a shell that offers what it cannot deliver.
 *
 * Sign out stays, because it is the one thing that always works, and because
 * "wrong Google account" is the single most likely reason somebody is stuck on
 * one of these pages at all.
