/**
 * One student's time with one mentor, wherever it is read.
 *
 * Three surfaces drew this and each did the same arithmetic differently. The
 * one that matters is what the bar means. `allocationSummary` writes an
 * expired allocation's `remaining` down to zero, so `allocated - remaining`
 * reads a grant that simply ran out of time as fully USED — and a full bar
 * tells a student they had their sessions when they had none. The bar is what
 * is GONE: spent plus forfeited. The figures underneath separate the two,
 * because a student who lost four hours to a deadline needs to know that is
 * what happened.
 *
 * Two shapes, one set of facts:
 *
 *   table  the staff ledger — every column, a use-by date, a ⋮ menu
 *   card   the student's own, and the mentor's: a balance, a bar, a date
