 * "Up next" — everything with a date on it, in one list.

 * `ScheduledMeetings` with a 56px violet calendar leaf per row; use-by dates
 * were a column in a table on another page; task due dates were a chip inside
 * a panel. A mentor asking "what is happening this week" had to visit three
 * places and merge them mentally.
 *
 * The rows are heterogeneous on purpose. What a reader wants from this section
 * is chronology, and a deadline three days out matters more than a meeting next
 * month regardless of which of the two is a "meeting".
 *
 * The `DateLeaf` is gone with the three lists. A torn calendar page per row is
 * 56px of decoration repeating the group header directly above it, and on a
 * phone it took a third of the row's width.
