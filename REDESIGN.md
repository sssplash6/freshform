# REDESIGN — the binding specification

**Status:** contract. This file supersedes `UX-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` as the plan of record and
overrides `DESIGN.md` wherever the two disagree (`DESIGN.md` is rewritten in Phase 8 to match).
Written 2026-09-03 from a 14-agent audit of all 33 routes and all 75 components, three competing
information architectures, three judge panels, and the owner's binding decisions.

**The complaint being answered, verbatim:** *"repetitions, text blocks, long text not rendering
right, too much noise, zero proper categorization and management of assets, too clowny because it
uses too many colors … everything feels all over the place. like why mentor sees bunch of nonsense
when on the homepage. or why we don't have separate settings icon and page for programs."*
**The goal:** *"super clean platform w no noise. everything should feel clean, organized."*

**What must survive untouched.** The ledger rules are correct and are not redesigned: whole
minutes; allotted = sum of `HourAllocation`; used = ACTIVE in-plan sessions; no-shows charge and are
tallied "missed"; EXTRA charges nothing; deadlines are hard, so unused minutes are forfeited and
logging is blocked after the date; voiding returns time; every allotment change is audited and
notified. **No UI goal may change an hours number** — the forfeiture arithmetic in `hours.ts` and
`queries.ts` is not rewritten by this plan.

## 1. The spine

**Triage.** Every role home is a typed *"Needs you"* list, one lead figure, and a seven-day
*"Up next"* timeline — and then nothing. History and browsing live behind list destinations with
server-side search, filters and pagination. Each entity (student, mentor, program) has exactly one
page, shared by every role and gated per-permission. One typed status model produces the inbox
rows, every table chip, the notification categories and the empty states, so a state is worded
once and rendered by one component.

This is chosen because it is the direct answer to the loudest sentence in the brief. Today a mentor
opening `/mentor` gets 634 lines: a greeting banner, six lifetime numbers, program "islands", an
empty diary, a recent-meetings log, a nine-column table, and two complete forms
(`mentor/page.tsx:404-632`). Under this spine the same person gets three lines: what needs them,
what is next, who is running out of time.

### Nine rules the whole document obeys

1. **One tree of objects.** A student is `/students/[id]`, a mentor `/mentors/[id]`, a program
   `/programs/[id]`, the ledger `/sessions`. No role prefix on a shared object.
2. **Authority is checked against the person and the object, on the server, never inferred from the
   URL — and never from the profile lens.** Every page calls its own gate; a layout gate is defence
   in depth, never the only gate. (This is the standing rule created by today's layout-only-auth
   fix; it also goes into `AGENTS.md`.)
3. **The profile is a lens, not a place, and it never removes a control.** See §3.
4. **Homes read; they do not edit.** Two stated exceptions, both one-tap answers to a typed
   question, never forms: a student answers a proposed meeting on their home; an admin approves a
   signup on the inbox row.
5. **One `h1`, one lead figure, hairlines.** No banner wash, no ghost monogram, no tinted panel
   header, no stat strip. A section is a title, an optional count, an optional action, one rule.
6. **One renderer per kind of thing.** `SessionRow`, `TaskRow`, `AllocationRow`, `TimelineItem`,
   `StatusChip`, `Figure`, `PersonCell` — each used everywhere its object appears.
7. **Status is a word with a glyph.** Four severities, two chromatic hues, a glyph on every
   chromatic chip. Never colour alone.
8. **Free text is always clamped and always expandable.** `ExpandableText` on every note, comment
   and purpose; chips wrap; tables never scroll sideways.
9. **Hints ≤ 12 words. Empty states are one sentence and carry no action button.**

### Grafted in from the two rejected architectures

| Taken from | What |
|---|---|
| calm-minimal | The subtraction discipline: a stated route budget, a named component ledger, the 34-file retirement list, `ExpandableText` on *every* free text, "tables never scroll sideways", the seven rules above (extended to nine), the quieter palette (`accent-soft` and `accent-dark` retired too, programs get no hue), the repaired `HoursRing` as the student's lead figure, "Sessions and Tasks side by side on ≥ lg" as the surviving `LedgerBoard` reading, the `/sessions/new` failure contract and **Log another**, the `/student/book` email fallback, the one-table grants editor, and the entire verification phase (§10, Phase 8). |
| entity-first | Union-of-rights on entity pages (§3), the sole write surface for admin grants (§8.4), count discipline (exactly two counted nav items), the one-`Callout`-per-page ceiling, the GOV.UK `FactList` for student details, the "program contact is a named person or the phrase is dropped" copy rule, redirects-with-an-expiry instead of a live-data `UPDATE`, `Program.staff → ProgramStaff` (the `deleteProgram` guard nobody else caught), zero-prose Programs list, inline **Approve** on the admin home, and the honest disabled action with its reason. |

### Rejected, and why

- **The near-invisible switch** (calm-minimal: no badge, "the `h1` is the tell") — the owner is the
  dual-role user and named the switch non-negotiable.
- **Hiding admin controls in mentor lens** — it makes the owner press ⌥M to allocate time while
  looking at a student. Replaced by the union of rights (§3).
- **Demoting mentor ratings** to an account-menu item and deleting the student-facing mentor page —
  decision 3 cut *website* feedback only.
- **A per-program `groupBy` for admin totals** — it cannot reproduce per-allocation forfeiture
  (`queries.ts:80-100`), so the admin lead figure would silently disagree with every student page.
  See §8.6.
- **Renaming `User.role`** (`ADMIN`/`STAFF`) — `platformAdmin` + `ProgramStaff` already does the
  work; the rename touches `import-masters.ts:184,227` and `weekly-digest.ts:429-465` for nothing.
- **Cosmetic file merges** (`submit-button` → `button`, `empty-state` + `error-state` → `states`) —
  churn with no user-visible gain. Every merge in §5.2 is justified by a shared field group and
  lands in the commit that rewrites its call sites.
- **An inline log form on the mentor home** — an embedded form is what made that page nonsense.
  Logging is a page.
- **Tab rows on `/mentors/[id]`** and the desktop staff rail for students — re-chroming what it
  de-duplicates. The mentor page is one scroll; students get a consumer shell.
- **A program tone picker / `Program.toneIndex`** — programs are identified by name only.
- **An `UPDATE` of stored `Notification.href`** — the only avoidable mutation of live data in the
  plan. Replaced by a redirect map with an expiry date (§2.3).
- **`/student/history`, `/sessions/scheduled`, a tabbed platform route** — route inflation. History
  is a section of `/student/meetings`; Scheduled is a `?view=` tab; Platform is one page.
- **`TaskType` + `Assignment.taskTypeId`, `Session.attendance`, `bookingUrl`, `Interview.kind`** —
  out of the plan (§11); they rewrite columns the ledger reads, and `taskTypeId` is the only real
  table rebuild the redesign would have added.
- **A persistence model for saved views** — URL presets only, per the brief.

## 2. Route plan

**Budget: 23 pages + 6 route handlers = 29 routes (from 33), 4 layouts (from 9), 2 error
boundaries (from 7).** A ceiling: a new route requires deleting one, and the commit that adds it
says which line of this table it changes.

### 2.1 Disposition of all 33 existing routes

| # | Route today | Disposition | Target | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/` | reshape | server `redirect()` to the profile's home; students → `/student` | 200 + a 1-second `<meta refresh>` skeleton today (`page.tsx:5-9`) |
| 2 | `/login` | reshape | `PublicCard`, `h1` "Sign in", one role-neutral line | Two contradicting paragraphs, two product names (`:9,35,66`) |
| 3 | `/unsubscribe` | reshape | `PublicCard`, hairline not orange, `Button` primitives | Hand-rolled buttons, decorative orange (`:47,66,72,85`) |
| 4 | `/notifications` | reshape | title row · filters · anchor rows · pagination | Rows are form buttons; every student href lands on `/student` (`notification-list.tsx:49-57`, `notify.ts:86`); the digest toggle sits in the feed (`:111-137`) |
| 5 | `/admin` | reshape | **Admin inbox** (§6.1) | Banner + strip + editable log before the only navigation into a program (`admin/page.tsx:77-200`) |
| 6 | `/admin/students` | move | `/students` | One students list in the product, not four |
| 7 | `/admin/students/[id]` | merge | `/students/[id]` | Two pages for one person; every session and task rendered twice here |
| 8 | `/admin/mentors` | move | `/mentors` | Edit lives on the list; the detail page has none |
| 9 | `/admin/mentors/[id]` | merge | `/mentors/[id]` | Two banner pages per mentor joined by "View profile" |
| 10 | `/admin/programs/[id]` | move | `/programs/[id]` | Role-neutral entity; leaders and sales share it |
| 11 | `/admin/programs/[id]/students` | move | `/programs/[id]/students` (mounts `StudentsList`) | Reimplements `ProgramStudentsIsland` line for line |
| 12 | `/admin/programs/[id]/settings` | move | `/programs/[id]/settings` | Right grouping, unreachable from nav; the gear the owner asked for |
| 13 | `/admin/feedback` | move | `/feedback` | Website feedback cut (decision 3); N+1 up to 25 queries (`feedback.ts:33-45`) |
| 14 | `/leader` | delete | `/admin` scoped, or `/programs/[id]` at scope 1 | Byte-identical to `/sales` bar 2 tokens |
| 15 | `/leader/students` | delete | `/students` scoped | Same table, one click from the same table |
| 16 | `/leader/feedback` | delete | `/feedback` scoped by `student.programId` | Leaks other programs' ratings (`leader/feedback/page.tsx:18-27`) |
| 17 | `/sales` | delete | `/admin` scoped | 100% duplicate |
| 18 | `/sales/students` | delete | `/students` scoped | 100% duplicate |
| 19 | `/mentor` | reshape | **Mentor inbox** (§6.2) | 634 lines, 7–8 blocks, 2 embedded forms |
| 20 | `/mentor/sessions` | move | `/sessions` (lens default `mentor=me`) | THE ledger for every role; delivers TODO batch 1 |
| 21 | `/mentor/students/[id]` | merge | `/students/[id]` | Second hand-built ordering of the same parts |
| 22 | `/mentor/feedback` | merge | `/feedback` (mentor lens) | Hand-rolled list beside an existing one |
| 23 | `/mentor/onboarding` | merge | `/onboarding` | Third "enter your name" form |
| 24 | `/mentors/[id]` | reshape | one mentor page, three views by viewer (§6.9) | Self-edit forms → `/settings`; the student view becomes a card that says yes |
| 25 | `/student` | reshape | **Student home** (§6.3) | Remaining stated 3× above the fold; 13-entry unpaginated history; nothing states what she owes |
| 26 | `/student/book` | reshape | the only per-mentor time surface (§6.5) | 8 dead cards; the subtitle promises a Telegram route the page lacks |
| 27 | `/student/feedback` | reshape | one form, merged history (§6.6) | Website card cut; ISO dates |
| 28 | `/student/onboarding` | merge | `/onboarding` (gains the PENDING step) | The PENDING wall lives on `/student` today (`student/page.tsx:42-58`) |
| 29 | `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` | keep | — | — |
| 30 | `/api/avatar/[id]` | keep | serves every role once the upload gate lifts | — |
| 31 | `/api/cron/deadline-reminders` | keep | becomes the **only** caller of `ensureDeadlineReminders` | Also runs on GET of 3 pages today (`admin/page.tsx:42`, `mentor/page.tsx:121`, `student/page.tsx:24`) |
| 32 | `/api/cron/weekly-digest` | keep | reads `NotificationPreference` after Phase 7 | — |
| 33 | `/api/email/unsubscribe` | keep | writes the `WEEKLY_SUMMARY` preference row | — |

### 2.2 New routes (10 pages, 1 handler)

`/students` · `/students/[id]` · `/mentors` · `/programs` · `/programs/[id]` ·
`/programs/[id]/students` · `/programs/[id]/settings` · `/sessions` · `/sessions/new` ·
`/feedback` · `/settings` · `/settings/platform` · `/onboarding` · `/student/meetings` ·
handler `/n/[id]` (marks a notification read, then 302s to its destination, so rows are real
anchors and middle-click works).

That is 14 new pages against 5 deleted and 9 merged/moved away — net 23. `/programs/[id]` keeps
tabs (Overview · Students · ⚙ Settings); `/sessions` has two tabs on one route
(`?view=logged|scheduled`); `/settings/platform` is one page of sections.

### 2.3 Redirects, with an expiry date

Phase 6 checks in a `next.config.ts` `redirects()` map: every moved route → its new address, 308
permanent. In the same commit, notification producers stop choosing role-prefixed hrefs
(`notify.ts:81-90`) and emit role-neutral ones. **Stored `Notification.href` rows are never
rewritten** — the redirect map covers them. Phase 8 deletes the map after one released version;
the deletion is a listed commit, not a someday.

---

## 3. The Admin | Mentor switch

Kept, as decided, and given a job it can do honestly.

- **Visible.** A two-segment `Segmented` control in the staff sidebar (`brand-soft` active segment,
  never orange), `aria-keyshortcuts="Alt+M"`, tooltip "⌥M"; a labelled row in the account sheet on
  phones. The active profile is readable without opening anything.
- **A cookie, not a route tree.** `profile=admin|mentor`, httpOnly, set by a `setProfile()` server
  action that revalidates. Every shared page reads it, which fixes the mode leak where they fall
  back to `user.role` (`notifications/layout.tsx:14`, `mentors/[id]/layout.tsx:19`).
- **It changes exactly four things:** (1) which home `/` resolves to (`/admin` or `/mentor`);
  (2) the sidebar item set; (3) the default filter on `/students`, `/sessions` and `/feedback`
  ("Just mine" vs "All in my programs"); (4) which action is *primary* on an entity page
  ("Log a session" in mentor lens, "Allocate time" in admin lens).
- **It never removes a control and never changes your place.** `/students/[id]`,
  `/mentors/[id]` and `/programs/[id]` always render the **union of the viewer's rights**
  (`canManageStudent ∪ mentorReaches`). ⌥M on an entity page repaints the rail and re-orders two
  buttons; the URL does not move and nothing disappears mid-task. This kills the counterpart map
  (`profile-switch.tsx:57-67`) and the fallback-to-the-other-home (`:108-110`).
- **Authority never comes from the lens.** `authz.ts` decides what a person may do to an object.
  The lens decides emphasis. A server action ignores the cookie entirely.
- **Calm without hiding.** Admin-only actions on a shared entity page group behind one labelled
  **⋮ Manage** menu in the header (Allocate time · Approve · Move program · Remove student), so the
  header carries at most two primary buttons in either lens while every right stays one click
  away — the middle between hiding admin power and dumping the union on the page.

---

## 4. Shell and navigation

### 4.1 Staff, ≥ lg — a 220px fixed left sidebar

The horizontal bar is over capacity by its own admission ("Four things do not fit a 320px row",
`app-shell.tsx:171-173`) and has no entry for Programs, Sessions, Notifications or Settings
(`nav.ts:13-39`). Labelled text items, never icon-only. The main column widens from `max-w-5xl`
(`app-shell.tsx:219`) to `max-w-6xl`.

```
freshlog                        ← wordmark, brand blue
[ Admin | Mentor ]              ← dual-role only, ⌥M
Find a student…                 ← submits to /students?q=
Inbox                     3     ← count = Needs-you rows
Students
Mentors
Programs                        ← collapses to the program's NAME when scope = 1
Sessions
Feedback
──────────
Notifications             4
⚙ Settings                      ← gear WITH the word
[avatar] Name                    ← menu: Settings · Platform · Switch profile · Help · Sign out
```

**Counts appear on exactly two items: Inbox (attention rows) and Notifications (unread).** No count
anywhere else in the chrome. Items come from `navFor(viewer, profile)`, derived from capabilities —
never from a static `NAV_BY_ROLE`.

Mentor lens: Inbox · Students · Sessions · Feedback. `ProgramStaff` level LEADER: Inbox · Students ·
Feedback · {Program}. Level SALES: Inbox · Students · {Program}.

### 4.2 Below lg

- **Staff, mentor lens:** bottom tabs **Inbox · Students · Sessions · Feedback**.
- **Staff, admin lens:** bottom tabs **Inbox · Students · Programs · More** (More is a sheet:
  Mentors, Sessions, Feedback, Settings, Switch profile). Admin is desktop-first and must not
  break; it does not.
- **Students, every width:** no sidebar ever — a student must never feel "accidentally let into an
  internal admin tool" (PRODUCT.md). A light top bar (wordmark · bell · avatar) plus a 4-item
  bottom tab bar below md: **Home · Meetings · Book · Feedback**. At ≥ md the same four become text
  links in the top bar. Student pages are `max-w-2xl`, centred. This retires the hidden `<details>`
  "Menu" (`app-shell.tsx:181-214`); NN/g measured hidden navigation at 27% use versus 48–50% visible.
- **Onboarding, PENDING and UNASSIGNED:** `PublicShell` — wordmark + sign out only. No nav that
  bounces the reader back (`book/page.tsx:35`), no bell.

### 4.3 Program context

There is no program switcher; programs are entities and filters, not silos. A reader knows which
program they are looking at from three places only: the program page's `h1` and breadcrumb, the
**Program** select in every `FilterBar` (mirrored in the URL), and the muted program suffix on
inbox and list rows. A scoped admin with one program sees that program's name in the sidebar
instead of "Programs".

---

## 5. The shared foundation

### 5.1 The typed status model — `src/lib/status.ts`

One file owns every state, its wording, its severity and its destination. Nothing else derives a
status: `flagsFor()` (`admin/programs/[id]/page.tsx:40-82`), `Deadline`, the three `PROGRESS_TONE`
maps, `INTERVIEW_STATUS_META`'s viewer-agnostic labels and 19 free-text `Chip` labels fold into it.

```ts
export type Severity  = "neutral" | "ok" | "attention" | "problem";
export type Kind      = "actionable" | "informational" | "blocked";
export type Audience  = "staff" | "mentor" | "student";

export type Status = {
  type: StatusType;          // stable string union, below
  severity: Severity;
  kind: Kind;
  label: string;             // ≤ 4 words, already resolved for this audience
  explanation?: string;      // ≤ 12 words, says what to do
  href?: string;
  subject?: { kind: "student" | "mentor" | "program"; id: string; name: string };
  program?: { id: string; name: string };
  at?: Date;                 // for ordering inside a severity band
  count?: number;            // set only on roll-up rows
};

export type ViewerContext = {
  audience: Audience;        // from role + lens, NOT authority
  userId: string;
  now: Date;                 // computed ONCE per request at the query layer
};

export function studentStatuses(s: StudentStatusInput, v: ViewerContext): Status[];
export function mentorStatuses(m: MentorStatusInput,  v: ViewerContext): Status[];
export function programStatuses(p: ProgramStatusInput, v: ViewerContext): Status[];
export function taskStatuses(t: TaskStatusInput,       v: ViewerContext): Status[];
export function sessionStatuses(s: SessionStatusInput): Status[];
export function meetingStatus(i: MeetingStatusInput,   v: ViewerContext): Status;
export function rollUp(list: Status[], opts?: { threshold?: number }): Status[];
export const SEVERITY_RANK: Record<Severity, number>;   // problem 0, attention 1, neutral 2, ok 3
export const EXPIRY_WINDOW_DAYS = { staff: 14, student: 30 } as const;
```

Rules: `now` is passed in and never read inside a component (this removes the
`Date.now()`-during-render class at `deadlines.ts:9-11` and `programs/[id]/page.tsx:74`). Severity
is the **only** thing that picks a colour; the glyph and the word always ride along
(`○` neutral · `✓` ok · `!` attention · `×` problem). A `blocked` state may render **one** `Callout`
per page; every other state is a chip, a row, or a figure tone. `rollUp` collapses more than three
statuses of the same type into one row — `"10 students have no time allocated →"` — which is what
keeps a first screen calm no matter what the data does.

| Type | Label — staff / mentor / student | Sev | Kind | Renders in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STUDENT_PENDING_APPROVAL` | Pending approval / — / Awaiting approval | attention | actionable (admin) · blocked (student) | admin inbox (**Approve** inline), student workspace header, students table, onboarding step 3 |

| `POOL_UNASSIGNED` | 3h not with a mentor | neutral | informational | workspace Time section, `/student/book` state line |
| `NO_MENTOR` | No mentor yet | attention | actionable (admin) | workspace header, student home |

| `MEETING_CONFIRMED` | Confirmed | ok | informational | timeline rows |
| `MEETING_DECLINED` | Student can't make it / — / You can't make it | problem | actionable (mentor: move or cancel) | timeline rows, mentor inbox |
| `MEETING_UNLOGGED` | Meeting passed, nothing logged | attention | actionable (mentor: log) · informational (admin) | mentor inbox, admin inbox, Up next "Overdue", `/sessions?view=scheduled` |

| `SESSION_RESCHEDULED` | Rescheduled, no time charged | neutral | informational | session rows |

| `TASK_NOT_STARTED` / `TASK_IN_PROGRESS` / `TASK_DONE` | ○ Not started / ◐ In progress / ✓ Done | neutral / neutral / ok | informational | task rows |
| `TASK_OVERDUE` | Due Aug 10, not done | attention | actionable (mentor, admin) | inboxes, workspace tasks, student home |
| `TASK_OVER_BUDGET` | 1h 20m over budget | problem | informational | task rows |
| `TASK_NEEDS_MENTOR` | Needs a mentor / — / Mentor to be confirmed | attention | actionable (admin) | task rows, admin inbox |
| `BOOKING_LINK_MISSING` | No booking link | attention | actionable (mentor → Settings) · informational (admin, student) | mentor inbox, mentor page, mentors table, program settings, book rows |
| `MENTOR_UNASSIGNED` | Not in any program / Waiting for a program | attention | actionable (admin) · blocked (mentor) | admin inbox, mentors table, mentor inbox |
| `MENTOR_NAME_MISSING` | Name missing | attention | actionable (mentor) | onboarding gate, mentors table |
| `FEEDBACK_LOW` | Low rating | attention | actionable (admin: review) | admin inbox, feedback table |
| `PROGRAM_ARCHIVED` | Archived | neutral | informational | program header, programs list |
| `PROGRAM_NO_MENTORS` | No mentors | attention | actionable (admin) | program overview, programs list |
| `STAFF_UNSCOPED` | No programs granted | problem | blocked | admin inbox, as ONE line (replaces three copies of the "staff configuration" sentence) |
| `DIGEST_OFF` | Weekly email off | neutral | informational | `/settings` row only — never on a home |
| `ALL_CLEAR` | Nothing needs you | ok | informational | empty `AttentionList` |

**Notification categories** are the same vocabulary: `Notification.category ∈ {HOURS, SESSIONS,
MEETINGS, TASKS, ACCOUNTS, DEADLINES, FEEDBACK, WEEKLY}`, mapped from the 17 existing types
(`constants.ts:239-257`) inside `notify()`. Two missing producers are added: `FEEDBACK_RECEIVED`
(program staff, and the rated mentor anonymised) and `WEEKLY_SUMMARY` (an in-app row, so the email
toggle maps to something visible).

### 5.2 The primitive set — 75 component files → 51

Each primitive names its API and what it deletes. **A file merge only lands in the commit that
rewrites its call sites — never as a standalone tidy-up.**

#### Kept as-is or trimmed (22)

`ui/table.tsx` (`Table/Tr/Td label`) · `ui/pagination.tsx` · `select.tsx` (full ARIA combobox; gains
`searchable`) · `ui/field.tsx` (gains `size="compact"` and a `NativeSelect` export) ·
`ui/button.tsx` · `ui/submit-button.tsx` · `ui/meter.tsx` (tones `accent | danger`, gains
`segments`) · `ui/callout.tsx` (tones `info | warn | danger`, always with a glyph) ·
`ui/empty-state.tsx` (restructured, **no `action` slot**) · `error-state.tsx` ·
`forms/program-settings-forms.tsx` (rebuilt on `SettingsRow`) ·
`expandable-text.tsx` · `icons.tsx` (extended) · `hours-breakdown.tsx` (three fills) ·
`hours-ring.tsx` (**repaired**, see below) · `avatar.tsx` (3 tones; absorbs the `EntityMark` role) ·

**Result: 22 kept + 29 new = 51 component files, from 75 — a 32% cut with 53 files retired.**
`forms/` alone goes from 28 files to 8: `session-forms`, `meeting-forms`, `hours-forms`,
`people-forms`, `profile-forms`, `platform-forms`, `feedback-form`, `program-settings-forms`.

#### `HoursRing`, repaired not deleted

`hours-ring.tsx:29` computes `remaining = allotted − used` and ignores forfeited, so on any student
with expired time the ring disagrees with the sentence beside it (`hours.ts:157`). **The fix is to
delete the ring's own arithmetic and pass `allocationSummary.remaining` in.** Promote that to a rule
for the whole reorg: *when two renderers disagree about a number, delete the one that recomputes it.*
It applies to every `StatCard`, `dl` strip and header tally that `Figure` replaces.

### 5.3 Long text — the systemic fix

Six recurring causes, none ever fixed system-wide. All six are closed; two are enforced by lint.

1. **`Chip` is `whitespace-nowrap`** (`chip.tsx:28`) with sentence-length labels ("Rescheduled, no
   time charged"). `StatusChip` wraps (`whitespace-normal text-pretty`); labels are capped at 4
   words by the status model and the ≤12-word explanation is a sibling line, not chip content.
2. **`truncate` on a flex child without `min-w-0`** never truncates (`ledger-board.tsx:156`).
   `scripts/check-copy.mjs` fails when a `className` has `truncate` and neither `min-w-0` nor
   `max-w-`.
3. **`ExpandableText` reached 3 of ≥9 free-text slots.** It now wraps every one — session and
   meeting notes, task purposes and notes, feedback comments, notification messages — `lines={2}`
   in rows, `lines={3}` in detail.
4. **Unbounded `Callout` bodies and panel captions** — bodies are one clause; captions become a
   typed `count` slot on `Section`.
5. **Bordered contact buttons inside subtitle prose** (`admin/students/[id]:158-184`) — contacts
   become quiet `ExternalLink` icons on their own line.
6. **7–9 column tables stacking to 9 labelled lines on a phone** — **every table is capped at 6
   columns**, a row stacks below `sm` (existing `Td label`), and no table scrolls sideways.

### 5.4 Disclosure — what may be collapsed, and what may not

Fifteen page specs above say `▸`. This is what `▸` is, and — more importantly — when a thing has
earned one.

Collapsing is the easiest way to make a page *look* calm while leaving its mess in place, so it
needs a rule rather than a habit. Six idioms exist in the code today for want of one: two
hand-styled `<details>`, `booking-link-form.tsx:73`'s `Show ▾` / `Hide ▴` text glyphs,
`program-forms.tsx`'s "New program" toggle **and** its "+ Add a cohort" link (one file, two
shapes), and `mentor-list.tsx:86`'s inline Edit. Left alone that becomes the fourth cluster of the
kind this plan exists to remove.

**The decision, in order. Stop at the first yes.**

| Ask | Then |
|---|---|
| Is it what the page is *for*? | **Show it.** Never collapse the primary thing. `/sessions/new` does not hide its fields. |
| Does it belong to a different question? | **Move it to its own address.** Not a disclosure — an address. This is how `/students`, `/sessions` and `/settings` came to exist. |
| Is it free text past its clamp? | **`ExpandableText`.** Notes, comments, task purposes. Never `Disclosure`. |
| Is it a menu of actions on one row? | **`RowActionMenu`.** ⋮ or pencil, a popover, not an expanding row. |
| Is it an occasional action *on this page's subject*? | **`Disclosure`.** "Add students ▸", "Register a mentor ▸", "Allocate time ▸", "New program ▸", "Add a cohort ▸", "Edit ▸". |
| Is it the finished, historical or settled subset of a list on the page? | **`Disclosure` with a count.** "Finished · 6 ▸", "History · 18 ▸", "Past sessions · 42 ▸". |
| Is it a fact you would only read when something is wrong? | **`Disclosure`.** The student page's "Details" (sign-in email, enrollment, folder, danger zone). |
| Anything else | It is noise. **Delete it.** |

**Rules for the primitive.**

1. **Native `<details>`/`<summary>`.** Keyboard and screen-reader behaviour arrives free, it works
   before hydration, and browsers now expand a closed `<details>` to reveal a find-in-page hit —
   which a `useState` version silently breaks. This is the one place the app prefers a native
   control without argument.
2. **A count whenever it hides countable rows**, in the summary, before it is opened:
   `Finished · 6 ▸`. Collapsing may hide the rows; it may never hide the magnitude. A count of zero
   renders no disclosure at all.
3. **The label names what is inside**, as a noun or an imperative — never "More", "Details" alone,
   or "Show". `Show ▾` is retired.
4. **One glyph**, a single chevron rotated by CSS on `[open]`, at 150 ms and zeroed under
   `prefers-reduced-motion`. Two text glyphs (`▾`/`▴`) are two states to keep in sync and neither
   is announced.
5. **Height is never animated.** Reflowing a table under the reader's cursor is worse than an
   instant open.
6. **No disclosure inside a disclosure.** Two levels of hidden is a page that needs splitting.
7. **`param` ties open state to a URL search param** (`?add=1`) for the ones worth linking to — the
   add-students and register-mentor forms, so "open this and add someone" is one link. Without
   `param` the state is local and forgotten on navigation, which is correct for everything else.
8. **A collapsed form still owns its fields.** `<details>` does not disable what it hides, so a
   `Disclosure` wraps a whole `<form>` and never half of one — otherwise a closed section keeps
   submitting.
9. **One per section, at most.** A section with two disclosures is two sections.

**What this retires:** `booking-link-form.tsx`'s toggle (the links move to `/settings` in Phase 7
and stop being a disclosure at all), both `program-forms.tsx` shapes, `mentor-list.tsx`'s inline
Edit (becomes `Edit ▸` on `/mentors/[id]`), and the two hand-styled `<details>` in `app-shell.tsx`
(become `Popover`, which is a menu, not a disclosure — §5.2).


### 5.5 Palette and tokens

The complaint in numbers: 12 chromatic hue families where the rule allows about 5; 24 identity
tokens (8 hues × 3); amber carrying five meanings and violet four on one screen; **106 raw Tailwind
palette classes across 41 files** (`text-red-700` ×36 in `.tsx`); `accent-ink` #f18d05 on white at
2.46:1; orange spent on ≥10 non-hours chrome elements.

**Keep** — `canvas #f4f5f6` · `surface #ffffff` · `line #e5e6e8` · `ink #1a2733` ·
`muted-fg #6b7480` · `brand #124b84` · `brand-dark #0e3c6a` · `brand-soft #e7eef5` ·
`accent #f18d05` · `accent-ink #f18d05` · `shadow-soft`.

**Add** — `warn-soft #fdf3de` · `warn-line #f2dcb0` · `warn-ink #8a5a08` (the old `log-*` hexes;
5.92:1 on white — the only amber that survives) · `danger #c10007` · `danger-soft #fef2f2` ·
`danger-line #ffc9c9` · `danger-ink #b42318` (already the email "lost" red) ·
`tone-teal-{soft,ink,dot} #dcefe6 / #175f4a / #2e8468` ·
`tone-plum-{soft,ink,dot} #f1e6ef / #6f2d68 / #8f4b88` ·
`tone-moss-{soft,ink,dot} #e8eedb / #485c1c / #5f7a2b` — all AA for ink-on-soft and white-on-dot.

**Retire** — `accent-ink-dark` (dead, 0 uses) · `accent-dark` · `accent-soft` (no orange button, no
orange wash, no orange ground remains) · `log-*` and `plan-*` as tints · all 24 `tone-*` tokens ·
`ProgramTone`, `PROGRAM_TONES`, `programTone()`, `personBanner()`, `PROGRAM_TONE_COUNT`
(`person-tone.ts`) · every `bg-gradient-to-br` wash (`page-header.tsx:87`) · every ghost monogram
(10 call sites) · `Panel` tones · `Chip` green and violet · `Callout tone="brand"` (which renders
orange) · all 106 raw palette classes.

**Eight rules.**

1. A hue never appears without its glyph or its word.
2. Orange = hours fills (`Meter`, `HoursRing` stroke, `HoursBreakdown` delivered) and ≥24px hours
   readouts (`Figure tone="hours"`). Never a button, chip, badge, tab, border, wash or role label.
   The 2.46:1 is a documented, accepted brand trade-off *at ≥24px only* — the owner has decided not
   to darken it, so it is never used at 10–15px.
3. Blue = chrome, links, primary action, focus, selection, unread. **Never a status.** The bell's
   unread count is `brand`, not `bg-red-500` (`app-shell.tsx:52`); sign-out hover is canvas/ink, not
   red (`:100,:206`).
4. Amber (`warn-*`) and red (`danger-*`) are the only chromatic status hues. `neutral` and `ok`
   share the neutral chip so "nothing wrong" is calm. **No green anywhere** — `ok` is a `✓` glyph in
   ink on a neutral chip.
5. Identity tones appear only on `Avatar`/`PersonChip`/`PersonCell`, from `User.toneIndex` (0-2).
   **Programs have no hue and no monogram** — a program is a place, not a person.
6. Two text tiers only: `ink` and `muted-fg`. No coloured eyebrows.
7. No gradients, tinted headers, watermarks, tilts or brand-tinted hover shadows. `shadow-soft` is
   for popovers only.
8. Every hairline is `line`. A section is separated by whitespace and at most one rule.

**The hours bar has three fills, not four:** delivered `accent`; missed-but-charged the *same*
accent as a 135° diagonal stripe; expired/overdrawn `danger`; remaining `line`. Today `bg-accent`
(35°) sits beside `bg-amber-400` (44°) — nine degrees apart, identical for deutan and protan
viewers (`hours-breakdown.tsx:59-66`). Legend swatches differ in **shape** as well as fill: filled
circle, striped square, ring.

**Guard rail:** `scripts/check-colors.mjs`, run from `npm run lint`, fails on any
`(text|bg|border|ring|stroke|fill|divide|outline|from|to|via)-(red|amber|green|emerald|yellow|blue|violet|purple|indigo|sky|cyan|teal|lime|orange|rose|pink|fuchsia|slate|gray|zinc|neutral|stone)-[0-9]`
under `src/`, with one allowlisted file for the Google logo (`login/page.tsx`).

### 5.6 Copy rules

1. **One noun each:** mentor · student · **session** (logged) · **meeting** (scheduled) · task ·
   program · cohort · booking link · time. Banned: *interview, diary, goal, assignment, allotment,
   enrollment, in-plan, pool, in flight, danger zone, staff configuration, active hours, Hrs*.
2. **One verb each:** Add (students) · Register (mentor) · New (program) · Log (session) ·
   Schedule / Move / Cancel (meeting) · Allocate / Correct (time) · Approve / Reject · Edit ·
   Remove · Archive.
3. **One label per quantity.** Remaining is **left** to students and **remaining** to staff, and
   nothing else; the ten current spellings ("Still yours", "Hrs left", "you can book", "still to
   deliver", …) all go.
4. **A figure carries its unit once** — never `2h 30m h left` (`mentor-hours-list.tsx:79`),
   `16h 52m hours logged`, `45 min unused minutes` (`deadline-reminders.ts:94`).
5. **Status = word + glyph**, ≤4-word label, ≤12-word explanation, per audience: a student reads
   "You can't make it", never "Student can't make it" (`constants.ts:203`).
6. **Empty states are one sentence** — what is empty, what normally fills it. No "appears here"
   (×14 today), no "the form below", never red, **never an action button**.
7. **No eyebrow sentences.** Eyebrows are ≤2-word nouns or nothing; provenance eyebrows ("Logged by
   mentors", "Granted by an admin") die with the tints that justified them.
8. **Address the reader.** Students: "you / your". Staff: the student's name.
9. **"Program contact" is a named person with a link, or the phrase is dropped.**
   `programContact(programId)` → `{ name, email } | null` (the program's first `ProgramStaff(ADMIN)`,
   else the platform admin), at most once per page. Today it appears 5× with no name and no link.
10. **Dates and times.** `formatDate` everywhere, no ISO strings. "Use by" for an allocation, "Due"
    for a task, and a zone label on every meeting time: **"15:00 Tashkent"**.
11. **Receipts are structured:** what changed · balance now · one next action, ≤20 words.
12. **Titles are nouns** — no greeting in a staff `h1`, no category labels, no metaphors. One
    product name in chrome: **freshlog**; "Freshman Academy" only on the `/login` card.
13. **Plain declaratives.** The em dash is not the default connective (60+ uses today), and no
    hedging ("so check back soon", "the usual case").
14. **Prose budgets** (§6) are a PR-checklist item. What is mechanical is enforced:
    `scripts/check-copy.mjs` fails lint on the banned phrases — `appears here`, `appear here`,
    `lands here`, `newest first`, `Hrs`, `config/app-config.ts`, `still to deliver`,
    `Talk to your`, `program contact` outside `programContact()`, `.toISOString().slice` — plus the
    `truncate`-without-`min-w-0` pattern.

### 5.7 Save, freshness and recovery

`SaveState` is the one indicator: `idle | editing | unsaved | saving | saved{at} | failed{retry}`,
rendered `✓ Saved 12:04` in ink. Every `FactList` row, `SettingsRow`, booking link and inline editor
owns one and saves independently; `useUnsavedChanges()` warns before navigation. Errors stay
**inline beside the field**, `Toaster` only echoes, and after any mutation the page re-reads
server-derived values — no client-side hour arithmetic, ever. Freshness is chrome: the admin inbox
carries one muted `Updated 09:12` from the server render time, and no other page claims it, because
no other page has the plumbing.

---

## 6. The pages

Sections are listed **in order**. "Prose" is the maximum words of helper text in that section —
labels, figures and row content do not count. No page opens with a banner, wash, monogram or strip.

### 6.1 Admin inbox — `/admin`

Viewers: platform admin, program admin, `ProgramStaff` LEADER/SALES, dual in admin lens.
Core question: *is anything in my programs waiting on me right now?*

| # | Section | Content | Prose | Built from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title row | `h1` "Inbox" · one muted line "3 programs · 41 students · 212h remaining" · `Updated 09:12` | 12 | `PageTitle` + `Figure inline` |
| 2 | Needs you | `AttentionList` grouped by kind, problems first: **Approvals** (pending signups, **Approve** inline) · **Time** (overdrawn, expiring ≤14d, expired unused, no time allocated) · **Meetings** (passed, nothing logged) · **Mentors** (not in any program, no booking link) · **Tasks** (overdue, needs a mentor) · **Feedback** (low rating). Row = `StatusChip` · subject · ≤12-word explanation · program (muted) · →. Cap 20, roll-up above 3 per type, then "N more →". Empty: "Nothing needs you." | 8 / row, 4 empty | `AttentionList` |
| 3 | Up next | Today / Next 7 days: meetings in scope (this is the first render of `ScheduledMeetings view="staff"`, implemented at `scheduled-meetings.tsx:48` and never used), use-by dates ≤7d, task due dates. ≤10 rows · "All scheduled →" | 4 | `Timeline` |
| 4 | Programs | One row per program in scope: name · students · mentors · remaining (`Figure inline`, danger if <0) · attention count · →. Hidden when scope = 1. No meter, no tilt, no hue, no monogram. | 0 | `Section` + `Table` |
| 5 | Recent | ≤5 read-only lines "Aug 30 · Malika logged 90 min with Aziz · Master's" · "All sessions →" | 0 | `SessionRow variant="line"` |

**Removed:** the banner + count sentence (`admin/page.tsx:77-79`), the orange "N mentors awaiting
assignment" pill (`:81-90` → a row), the amber approvals `Callout` (`:94-131` → group 1),
`StatCardGrid` (`:133-149`), the editable `MeetingsLog` (`:151-158`), `CreateProgramForm` (`:165` →
Platform), the `ProgramIslandCard` grid (`:167-199`). Zero grants → one line: `STAFF_UNSCOPED`.

### 6.2 Mentor inbox — `/mentor`

Core question: *who am I meeting this week, what needs my answer or a logged session, and who is
running out of time?* What a mentor sees on Monday morning, in three lines:

```
Inbox                                    12h 40m left across 6 students   [Log a session]

```

| # | Section | Content | Prose | Built from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title row | `h1` "Inbox" · lead `Figure` "12h 40m left across 6 students" · primary **Log a session** → `/sessions/new` (full width under the title below md, so it is the first thing a thumb finds) | 6 | `PageTitle` + `Figure lead` |
| 2 | Needs you | Meeting passed with nothing logged (→ `/sessions/new?meeting=`) · no booking link per pairing (→ `/settings`) · student expiring ≤14d or overdrawn with me · expired with me · overdue task assigned to me · awaiting the student's answer (informational) · pending approval (informational) · UNASSIGNED mentor sees one `blocked` row "Waiting for a program". Cap 10. Empty: "Nothing needs you." | 8 / row | `AttentionList` |
| 3 | Up next | Overdue · Today · Next 7 days: my meetings with status chip, zone-labelled time, Join link, and **Move / Cancel** in a `RowActionMenu` **only on my own rows** (today `InterviewRowActions` renders on every row, `scheduled-meetings.tsx:131-141`) · use-by dates ≤7d · "All scheduled →" | 4 | `Timeline` |
| 4 | Your students | ≤8 rows: `PersonCell` (one chip) · left with you · use by · last session · →. Program `SegmentedRadio` filter only when >1 program. "All students →" | 0 | `StudentsTable preset="mentor"` |

**Removed:** the greeting banner (`mentor/page.tsx:404-415`), six lifetime `StatCard`s
(`:417-436`), `ProgramToggleIsland` (`:438-458`), the recent-meetings log (`:470-477` →
`/sessions`), the 9-column table (`:381-392`), `BookingLinksForm` (`:589-599` → `/settings`),
`LogSessionForm` (`:601-632` → `/sessions/new`).

**Caseload is defined here, once — it is the loudest bug in the mentor's Monday.** "My students" =
`mentorReaches`: allocation ∪ ever-met ∪ `MentorAssignment` on the student's program (cohort-scoped
where set) — the rule already written four times (`interviews.ts:46-74`, `sessions.ts:229-275`,
`mentor/students/[id]/page.tsx:63-109`, `admin/students/[id]/page.tsx:93-106`). Rows sort "holding
time with you" first and a student with no allocation shows an em dash, **never dropped**. Today a
mentor with no allocations sees zero students while the picker offers eleven.

### 6.3 Student home — `/student`

Core question: *how much time do I have left, what do I need to do next, when am I meeting someone?*
Phone-first. **The first "Needs you" row must begin above 420px at 390×664** — verified by
screenshot in Phase 8.

| # | Section | Content | Prose | Built from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Title row | eyebrow program · `h1` "Hi, Aziza" · `HoursRing` **96px** beside the h1 (not a full-width hero), repaired to read `allocationSummary.remaining` · quiet "Book a session →" link | 6 | `PageTitle`, `HoursRing` |
| 2 | Needs you | Student-voiced: meeting awaiting your answer (with **I'll be there / I can't make it** inline — the one write on this page) · overdrawn · time expired · task overdue · time expiring ≤30d · no mentor yet · no calendars shared yet. Empty: "Nothing to do right now." | 10 / row, 5 empty | `AttentionList voice="student"` |
| 3 | Up next | Today / Next 7 days meetings, zone-labelled, with Join; task due dates ≤7d. Empty: "Nothing scheduled." (distinct from "nothing available") | 6 | `Timeline` |
| 4 | Your time | `HoursBreakdown` bar + a key of **delivered · missed · expired** only — remaining is the ring and is never stated twice | 4 | `HoursBreakdown` |
| 5 | Working on | In-progress and not-started `TaskRow`s (purpose, mentor chip, logged/budget `Meter`, due chip). "N finished ▸" as one collapsed line | 4 | `TaskRow` |
| 6 | Latest change | One line: the newest notification + "All notifications →" | 0 | `NotificationItem` compact |

**Removed:** the orange gradient hero and 120px watermark (`student/page.tsx:77-88`), the balance
sentence (`:96` — a third statement of one number), both red `Callout`s (`:139-152` → Needs you),
`StudentJourney` (13 unpaginated entries, ~1200px → `/student/meetings`), `MentorHoursList` (→
`/student/book`), the footer counts (`:126-135`). The PENDING wall (`:42-58`) → `/onboarding` step 3.

### 6.4 Student meetings — `/student/meetings` (new)

1. `PageTitle` "Meetings" — 0 prose. 2. **Coming up**: `TimelineItem` rows — date · mentor chip ·
zone-labelled time · status word · `MeetingResponse` (**I'll be there / I can't make it**) when
proposed, then a quiet "Change answer". Empty: "Nothing scheduled. Your mentors schedule meetings
here." — 8. 3. **Past sessions**: `SessionRow variant="timeline"` (the rail from `StudentJourney`
survives here) — date · mentor · minutes · task · note (`ExpandableText`) · one exception chip · a
quiet **Rate** link → `/student/feedback?mentor=`. Paginated 20. Empty: "No sessions yet." — 3.

### 6.5 Book — `/student/book`

1. `PageTitle` "Book a session" — 0. 2. One state row, only when needed: "No calendars shared yet.
Email your mentors below." / "3h not yet assigned to a mentor." — ≤12. 3. `AllocationRow` per
mentor **holding time or a booking link**, ordered by use-by: `PersonChip` · **13h 10m left** · thin
accent `Meter` · "Use by 30 Nov" (`StatusChip` soon/expired) · primary **Book** (brand blue,
`ExternalLink`) **or** muted "No booking link" + the mentor's **email as a `mailto` `ExternalLink`**.
An expired or overdrawn pairing shows the red state instead of a Book button. **Mentors with no
allocation and admin-only accounts are hidden**; a bookable mentor must have a full name.
0 prose.

This closes the product's worst dead end: 0 of 8 Master's pairings have a link, so today the page
is eight dashed placeholders under a subtitle promising a Telegram route it does not offer — with
"Freshman Academy Admin" offered as bookable (`book/page.tsx:66-70,152`).

### 6.6 Feedback (student) — `/student/feedback`

1. `PageTitle` "Rate a mentor" — 0. 2. One `FeedbackForm`: mentor `Select` (preselected from
`?mentor=`, limited to mentors with a session or an allocation), stars, comment, one line "Your name
isn't shown to the mentor." — 8. 3. "What you've said": one list by date — `PersonChip` · stars ·
`ExpandableText` · `formatDate` — 3. The website card and `WebsiteFeedback` are gone (decision 3).
A student with no profile is redirected to `/onboarding` instead of shown a raw red box
(`feedback/page.tsx:19`).

### 6.7 Student workspace — `/students/[id]`

Viewers: platform/program admin (full), LEADER/SALES (read + folder), mentor with reach (log,
schedule, own corrections), dual (union; lens sets which action is primary).
Core question: *how much time is left, with whom, until when — and what needs doing now?*

| # | Section | Content | Prose | Built from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Header | back "Students" · `h1` name · one line: Program › Cohort · email · Telegram · Folder as quiet `ExternalLink` icons · ONE `StatusChip` (highest severity; "Pending approval" carries **Approve** / **Reject** beside it for an admin) · actions: **Log a session** (enabled only when `mentorReaches ∧ ACTIVE ∧ (allocation ∨ pool)`, otherwise disabled **with its reason**), **Schedule a meeting**, and **⋮ Manage** (Allocate time · Move program · Remove student) | 0 | `PageTitle`, `RowActionMenu`, `ConfirmInline` |
| 2 | Needs attention | This student's statuses only; hidden when empty | 10 / row | `AttentionList` |
| 3 | Time | Lead `Figure` remaining (the only `lead` on the page; danger + the word "over" when negative) · `HoursBreakdown` · then `AllocationRow` per mentor and the unassigned pool: mentor · left · used of total · use-by chip · ⋮ (Correct · Remove). A mentor viewer's own row is first and labelled "you". "History · 18 ▸" = the `HourAllotmentChange` audit, paged 20 | 8 | `Figure`, `HoursBreakdown`, `AllocationRow` |
| 4 | Up next | `Timeline` Overdue · Today · Next 7 days, with **Move / Cancel** for the owning mentor and **Log** (prefilled) on an overdue row | 0 | `Timeline` |
| 5 | Sessions | `SessionsTable`, last 10, all mentors: date · mentor · minutes · task · note (`ExpandableText`) · exception chip only · ⋮ (own sessions; admin all) · "All sessions with this student →" (`/sessions?student=`) | 3 | `SessionsTable` |
| 6 | Tasks | `TaskTable`: task · mentor (or "Needs a mentor") · logged/budget + thin `Meter` · due chip · progress glyph · ⋮. "Finished · 6 ▸" collapsed | 0 | `TaskTable` |
| 7 | Details | Collapsed `FactList` (admin; LEADER/SALES see folder only): Sign-in email · Program / cohort · Folder · Telegram · Registered · Approval — each with inline **Change** + `SaveState`. "Remove student" with its blocked reason: "Can't be removed: they have logged sessions." | 12 (inside fields) | `FactList`, `SettingsRow`, `ConfirmInline` |

**On ≥ lg, sections 5 and 6 sit side by side in a two-column grid** (stacked below). That is how
the deleted `LedgerBoard` earns its keep: `DESIGN.md:88-94` prized holding both halves at once, and
a CSS grid preserves that reading while every session and task renders exactly once.

**Deleted here:** `LedgerBoard` and `StudentLedger` (every session and task rendered twice —
`ledger-board.tsx:135-184, 186-248` against `meetings-log.tsx:167-283` and
`assignments-panel.tsx:99-194`, over-budget red on one and amber on the other), the 5–8 `StatCard`s
(`student-ledger.tsx:64-95`), seven stacked `Panel`s in three tints, the approval `Callout`
(`:187-196`), `StudentFolderForm` and `StudentCorrections` as panels, and the fourth copy of the
reach rule (`:93-106`).

### 6.8 Students list — `/students`

1. `PageTitle` "Students · 41" · **Add students ▸** disclosure (admin/leader/sales; sales capture
amount paid where the program tracks it) — 0 prose (10 inside the disclosure).
2. `FilterBar`: search (name/email) · Program · Cohort · presets **Pending · Overdrawn · Expiring ·
No time · Not signed in** · **Mine** (default on in mentor lens) · "Showing 12 · Reset" — all URL
params, all in the Prisma `where`, never a `.filter()` over everything.
3. Table, **6 columns**: `PersonCell` (name, email, ONE chip) · Program (cohort as a muted suffix) ·
Left (danger if <0; muted "of 12h") · Use by (nearest; "· expired") · Last session · one icon cell
(Telegram, Folder). Mentor lens reads "Left with you". Default sort: attention first, then program,
name. Rows link to the workspace. 4. `Pagination` 25. Empty (no results): "No students match. Reset
filters." — 5.

This also fixes the missing forfeiture column: today a student at 0h because their time **expired**
is indistinguishable from one who used it (`students-table.tsx` omits `forfeitedMinutes`).

### 6.9 Mentor page — `/mentors/[id]`

One route, one file, three views by viewer. No tabs.

**Staff view:** 1. Header — name · email · programs as text · one chip · **Edit ▸** (name/email;
platform admin only when the target is another admin) — 0. 2. Needs attention (no booking link, not
in any program) — 8/row. 3. Students holding time, `AllocationRow` by use-by → workspace — 0.
4. Delivered — period `Select` (30 days / 90 days / all) · three `Figure`s (delivered · meetings ·
missed) · per-program rows without meters and **without the two footer sentences**
(`admin/mentors/[id]/page.tsx:306-341`) — 0. 5. Recent sessions (10) → `/sessions?mentor=` — 0.
6. One line "4.6 · 12 ratings →" — 0.

**Student view:** `Avatar` · name · programs in common · one blue **Book** per pairing with a link,
or the mentor's email as an `ExternalLink` — never a dashed placeholder · "Rate this mentor →".
≤20 words on the page. (Today this is a 56-word page that says "Book a session" three times and then
says no.)

**Self view:** the staff view minus admin actions, plus "Edit your profile and booking links →
Settings". The forms leave this page (`mentors/[id]/page.tsx:125-159`).

### 6.10 Mentors list — `/mentors`

1. `PageTitle` "Mentors · 12" · **Register a mentor ▸** disclosure — 0 (8 inside).
2. `FilterBar`: search · Program · presets **Unassigned · No booking link**.
3. Table: `PersonCell` ("Admin" as a muted text suffix, never a green chip) · Programs (plain text) ·
Booking links ("1 of 2 set") · Students holding time · one status chip. Unassigned first.
4. `Pagination` 25. **Removed:** the orange "Awaiting assignment" box
(`admin/mentors/page.tsx:95-125`), the always-open register form, per-row inline edit with its
N+1 `ProgramTargetsPicker` (`mentor-list.tsx:86-138`).

### 6.11 Programs list — `/programs`

Admin lens; the sidebar item collapses to the program's name when scope = 1.
`PageTitle` "Programs · 3" · **New program ▸** (platform admin) · `TabLinks` **Active · Archived** ·
one row per program: name · students · mentors · remaining · attention count · →.
**Prose 0. No monogram, no hue, no meter, no tilt.**

### 6.12 Program overview — `/programs/[id]`

Header: back · `h1` program name · one line "41 students · 6 mentors · 212h remaining"
(`Figure inline`, danger when negative) · `StatusChip` "Archived" when archived · actions
**Add students ▸** and **⚙ Settings** (gear *with* the word). Tabs: **Overview | Students | ⚙
Settings**.

1. Needs attention — `AttentionList` across the program's students and mentors; when empty, one
line "Nothing needs attention." — 3. 2. Up next — `Timeline`, 7 days, staff view — 0. 3. Mentors —
one line each: name · booking-link chip → mentor page; ≤10 then "All →" — 0. 4. "Last session Aug 30
by Malika · All sessions →" — 0.

**Removed:** the program-hue banner and 104px monogram (`layout.tsx:52`), the 4–6 `StatCard`s that
repeated the subtitle (`page.tsx:170-189`), the 12-row editable `MeetingsLog` (`:224`), the violet
"Tasks in flight" panel (`:233`), the duplicated Mentors list (`:334-356` ≡ settings `:173-197`).
The layout's `program.findUnique` + `studentsWithHours` and the page's identical pair are wrapped
in `cache()` so they run once (`layout.tsx:26-42` vs `page.tsx:97-107`).

### 6.13 Program students — `/programs/[id]/students`

Exactly `StudentsList` (§6.8) with the program fixed and the Program filter hidden; **Add
students ▸** on the right. This is where leaders and sales add students. 0 prose beyond the
disclosure's one sentence.

### 6.14 Program settings — `/programs/[id]/settings` (the gear the owner asked for)

| # | Section | Content | Prose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mentors | One `SettingsRow` per pairing: name · cohort · booking-link chip · **Remove** (`ConfirmInline`). **Assign a mentor**: `Select` + button. This is the ONE write surface for pairings. | 0 |
| 2 | Cohorts | Rows with "12 students · 3 mentors" · Delete when empty · **Add a cohort ▸** with the flat-to-cohort rule as the disclosure's hint | 7 (inside) |
| 3 | Admins | **Read-only** list of this program's `ProgramStaff` rows with their level. Platform admin sees "Manage on Platform →". | 0 |
| 4 | Program | Name (`SettingsRow` + `SaveState`) · **Track amount paid per allocation** toggle (`Program.tracksPayment`, replacing the `MASTERS_PROGRAM_NAME` match at four sites) · **Archive program** (`ConfirmInline`: leaves every picker and home, keeps every ledger page reachable) | 10 |
| 5 | Delete | **Delete program** (`ConfirmInline`), only when empty, with a plain blocked reason and **never a file path** (`settings/page.tsx:83`, `programs.ts:153`) | 12 |

**Cut:** the "Enrolled students" removal panel — removal lives on the student's own page.

### 6.15 Sessions — `/sessions` (tabs) and `/sessions/new`

**`/sessions?view=logged`** (default): `PageTitle` "Sessions" · one filtered summary line
("96h logged · 3h missed · 2h extra") · `TabLinks` **Logged | Scheduled** · `FilterBar` (Student ·
Mentor [staff] · Program · Date range · Attendance · Kind · Status · **Mine**) · `SessionsTable`
(Date · Student · Mentor · Duration · Task (ink, not violet) · Notes (`ExpandableText`) · exception
chip only — no "Logged" chip on every row · ⋮) · `Pagination` 25. Mentor lens defaults
`mentor=me`. **This is the admin ledger from TODO batch 1, and it replaces `MeetingsLog` on six
surfaces.**

**`/sessions?view=scheduled`**: `Timeline`, **Overdue** first · `FilterBar` (Status · Date range ·
Mentor · Student). Meetings keep their calendar shape and sessions their table shape — the
ahead/behind split `DESIGN.md` argues for, as two tabs instead of two tints. This is the staff
meetings destination that does not exist today (`ScheduledMeetings view="staff"` finally renders).

**`/sessions/new`** — a full page, because on a phone that is the difference between usable and not:
1. back · `h1` "Log a session" — 0. 2. Form: Student (`Select`, searchable, recents, prefilled from
`?student=`, showing "11h 20m left with you" underneath) · Task (`Select`: the student's open tasks,
then the presets, then "Something else", each option saying why it is relevant) · Minutes · Date ·
Attendance (`SegmentedRadio`, consequence line ≤8 words: "No-show still charges time.") · Kind
(`SegmentedRadio`: "Extra charges nothing.") · Note. `SubmitButton` with a **duplicate-submit
guard**; **values preserved on failure**; **errors adjacent to their field**; the draft is
reflected in the URL so a phone interruption or a back button does not lose it. Prefilled from
`?meeting=` when it discharges a `MEETING_UNLOGGED` row. — 16.
3. `Receipt` on success, replacing the form: "Logged 90 min with Aziz. 11h 20m left." ·
**Correct** · **Log another** · **Back to student** — 8.

### 6.16 Feedback — `/feedback`

Staff: `PageTitle` "Feedback" · one muted summary line · `FilterBar` (Mentor · Program · Rating ≤ ·
Date range) · a compact mentors table (mentor · average as a number with small ink stars · ratings ·
lowest recent · last rated · `StatusChip warn` "Low" when the average <3.5 or any rating ≤2 in 30
days), **default lowest average first** (today it is ordered by rating *count*, which hides
low-rated mentors — `feedback.ts:26`) · one chronological list (`FeedbackList`) · one `Pagination`.
LEADER scope filters by **`student.programId`**, which closes the cross-program leak at
`leader/feedback/page.tsx:18-27`. Mentor lens: "4.6 · 12 ratings · anonymous" then rows, no strip.
The N+1 (2 queries per mentor, up to 25 — `feedback.ts:33-45`) becomes one grouped query.

### 6.17 Notifications — `/notifications`

1. Title row: `h1` "Notifications" · "4 unread" · **Mark all read** — 0. 2. `TabLinks` **All ·
Unread** + category `Select` (Time · Sessions · Meetings · Tasks · Account · Deadlines · Feedback ·
Weekly summary) — URL params, a server `where` on `Notification.category` — 0. 3. Rows as **real
anchors** `<a href="/n/[id]">` (marks read, then 302s to the destination, so middle-click works —
today each row is a `<form><button>` and every student href lands on the top of `/student`) : unread
`brand` dot · message (`ExpandableText`) · muted "Sessions · 2 h ago" · → . One `warn`/`danger`
chip only for missed, voided and deadline — 0. 4. `Pagination` 50. Empty: "Nothing new. Changes to
your time land here." — 8. 5. One muted line "Email preferences →" — 3.

**Removed:** the orange banner and 21-word blurb (`:66-71`), the second panel header (`:73-87`),
three statements of "newest first", the count stated four ways, and the digest form (`:111-137`).

### 6.18 Settings — `/settings`

`SettingsRow`s with per-row `SaveState`. 1. **Profile** — picture, full name (every role: the
`canActAsMentor` gate at `profile.ts:33-36,63-66,107-110` is lifted so students and non-mentor
admins finally own a name and a picture), sign-in email (read-only) — 0. 2. **Contact** — Telegram
(students; today captured once at onboarding and never editable) — 0. 3. **Booking links**
(mentors) — one row per pairing, program named, hint "Students book you through this link." — 6.
4. **Email** — weekly summary toggle, then the per-category in-app/email matrix (Phase 7), line "A
Monday summary of time used and deadlines." — 8. Reached from the sidebar gear and the account menu.
**40 words of hints on the whole page.**

### 6.19 Platform — `/settings/platform` (platform admin only)

1. `PageTitle` "Platform" — 0. 2. **Program access** — one table: person · level per program
(Admin / Leader / Sales) · **Edit** → inline `GrantsEditor` (program checkboxes × level select) ·
`SaveState` · **Add person** (any mentor, staff, or an email). Hint: "Program admins manage that
program's students, mentors and time." — 10. **The sole write surface for admin grants; it replaces
`STAFF_SEED` as the way admins are made** (decision 1), and §6.14 shows the same rows read-only.
3. **Programs** — name · status · students · Archive/Restore · **New program ▸** — 0.
4. **Organisation** — read-only: sign-up domain, email live/dry-run, cron last run — 0.

### 6.20 Onboarding and public pages

**`/onboarding`** — one gate, `PublicShell`, one `h1`, one sentence, one form, ≤12 words per branch:
"Your name" (mentor) · "Welcome to {Program}" (staff-registered student: name + Telegram) ·
"Complete your registration" (self-signup: name, Telegram, program, cohort) · **"Registration
received. An admin will approve you shortly."** (PENDING — moved off `/student`). Merges
`/student/onboarding` and `/mentor/onboarding` and kills the third "enter your name" form.

**`/login`** — `PublicCard`: wordmark · `h1` "Sign in" · `Callout danger` on `?error` · **Continue
with Google** · one line "Students use the email their program registered; staff use
@freshman.academy." (which resolves the contradiction between `login/page.tsx:9` and `:66`) — ≤20.
**`/unsubscribe`** — the same card, three states kept, `Button`/`LinkButton` primitives, a hairline
instead of the orange rule — ≤20.

---

## 7. Every contradiction, resolved

The completeness critic listed twelve cross-agent contradictions. All twelve are decided here; none
goes back to the owner.

| Contradiction | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Admin/mentor data model** (three incompatible proposals) | Explicit `ProgramStaff(userId, programId, role ADMIN\|LEADER\|SALES)` + `User.platformAdmin`. Scope comes from **explicit grants only**, never derived from `MentorAssignment` — derivation makes `setMentorAllocation`'s auto-pairing (`students.ts:786-797`) a privilege-escalation path, and would leave the admin who does not mentor with zero scope. Seeded once: every current ADMIN gets a grant for every program; tech@ becomes `platformAdmin`. `User.programId` is emptied and stops being read now, dropped in Phase 8. `Program.staff` becomes `ProgramStaff[]` and `deleteProgram`'s `_count.staff` guard (`programs.ts:139,150`) re-points at it in the same commit. |
| **LedgerBoard's fate** | Deleted. Its side-by-side reading survives as a two-column CSS grid on ≥ lg (§6.7). Every session and task is rendered once. |
| **Green as a status hue** | None anywhere. `ok` is a `✓` glyph in ink on the neutral chip. |
| **Blue as a status hue** | Never a status: chrome, links, primary action, focus, selection, unread. |
| **Program identity hue** | None. Name only; `PROGRAM_TONES`, `programTone()`, `personBanner()` and every program monogram are deleted, and there is no `Program.toneIndex`. |
| **Amber's survival** | One meaning: **attention** (`warn-*`, the old `log-*` hexes). Never a panel tint, an identity hue or a bar segment again. `text-amber-700` on "Missed" cells becomes `text-ink` (a labelled column is a fact), over-budget becomes `danger` (that *is* a problem), and a missed session is never softened — the chip reads "No-show, time charged" with an `!` glyph. |
| **Navigation shape** | Hybrid: 220px labelled sidebar ≥ lg, bottom tabs < lg for staff; students get a top bar plus 4 bottom tabs < md. Counts on exactly two items. |
| **Settings route name** | `/settings` (personal, every role) · `/settings/platform` · entity settings on the entity, reached by a gear **with the word "Settings"**. `/me`, `/mentor/settings`, `/account` and a renamed `/mentors/[id]` are rejected: one address per preference. |
| **`/mentors/[id]` audience** | One route, three views by viewer (§6.9): the student view survives and becomes useful (Book, contact, Rate), staff get the workspace at the same URL, LEADER keeps today's access. |
| **Mentor nav contents** | Inbox · Students · Sessions · Feedback, with Notifications and Settings in the sidebar footer. "My profile" as a nav item is gone. |
| **Recent sessions on the mentor home** | Cut (→ `/sessions`): the mentor logged them. The **admin** inbox keeps ≤5 read-only lines, because a cross-program admin has no other ambient view. |
| **Student history destination** | A **Past sessions** section of `/student/meetings`, paginated 20. No `/student/progress` or `/student/history`: the tabs are Home · Meetings · Book · Feedback, and Feedback stays a tab because decision 3 kept ratings first-class. |
| **Empty-state action buttons** | `EmptyState` has **no `action` slot**. An action never appears only because a list is empty; it lives in the section header, where it lives when the list is full. |
| **Interview time zone** | Keep the stored wall-clock (`format.ts:97-109` is deliberate), **label it** "15:00 Tashkent", and bucket today/overdue in `Asia/Tashkent` rather than UTC against the server clock (`interviews.ts:25-27`) — between 00:00 and 05:00 Tashkent, "today" currently reads as overdue. |
| **"Unassigned mentor" count queries** | One `mentorsNeedingSetup()` behind the status model feeds both surfaces; the two disagreeing queries (`admin/page.tsx:52-54`, `mentors/page.tsx:28`) collapse. |
| **Counts quoted in different units** | The audited figures of record: **106 raw palette occurrences across 41 files**, `text-red-700` **×36** in `.tsx`, **57** `StatCard` instances in 10 files, **75** components, **33** routes, **11** `requireRole(ROLES.ADMIN)` call sites (9 pages + 2 layouts, verified today). |
| **TODO.md vs code** | Rewritten in Phase 8. Batch 1's pagination and student search are already done; batch 2's `Date.now()`-in-render item closes with the status model's injected `now`. |
| **Deploy premise** | `autoDeploy: false`; hand deploys at milestones; `main` pushed continuously, one logical change per commit. The start command's `db:seed` is handled in §8.5. |
| **Docs vs decisions** | Phase 8 rewrites `PRODUCT.md`'s orange line, `DESIGN.md`'s Color and Components, `README.md`'s roles table, and regenerates `docs/guides/*.pdf` from `src/lib/brand.ts`, killing the third palette. |
| **MeetingsLog student link** | Fixed by construction: with one `/students/[id]`, the hard-coded admin link that bounced a plain mentor (`meetings-log.tsx:188-193`) cannot exist. |

---

## 8. Data, permissions and the things that break

### 8.1 Schema changes, in dependency order

Every migration is hand-written SQL under `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`
(repo convention — Prisma's scaffolded SQLite redefinitions drop data; see the header of
`20260829110000_durations_in_minutes`). Rebuilds wrap in
`PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys=ON; PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF; … ON`. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
against `prisma/dev.db` locally before pushing.

| ID | Phase | Change | SQLite shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M1** | 1 | `User.toneIndex INTEGER` | `ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "toneIndex" INTEGER;` then backfill sequentially by rowid `% 3` (a hash `% 3` is not expressible in SQLite). Chips recolour once — expected with the 8→3 cut. |
| **M2** | 3 | `ProgramStaff` + `User.platformAdmin`, grants seeded, `User.programId` emptied | `CREATE TABLE "ProgramStaff" (id TEXT PK, userId TEXT NOT NULL, programId TEXT NOT NULL, role TEXT NOT NULL, createdById TEXT, createdAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, FK userId→User, FK programId→Program)` + `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "ProgramStaff_userId_programId_key"` + `ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "platformAdmin" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;` + `INSERT INTO "ProgramStaff" … SELECT u.id, p.id, 'ADMIN' … FROM "User" u CROSS JOIN "Program" p WHERE u.role = 'ADMIN';` + `UPDATE "User" SET "platformAdmin" = true WHERE email = 'tech@freshman.academy';` + `UPDATE "User" SET "programId" = NULL;`. **Additive only — no table rebuild.** |
| **M3** | 6 | `Program.status`, `archivedAt`, `tracksPayment` | Three `ADD COLUMN`s with constant defaults (`status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE'`), then `UPDATE "Program" SET "tracksPayment" = 1 WHERE name = 'Master''s Program';`. No `createdAt`/`position`: SQLite forbids `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` as an `ADD COLUMN` default, and programs order by name. |
| **M4** | 6 | `Notification.category`, `readAt` | `ADD COLUMN "category" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'OTHER'` + `ADD COLUMN "readAt" DATETIME` + the backfill `UPDATE … SET category = CASE WHEN type = 'HOURS_GRANTED' THEN 'HOURS' WHEN type LIKE 'SESSION_%' THEN 'SESSIONS' WHEN type LIKE 'INTERVIEW_%' THEN 'MEETINGS' WHEN type LIKE 'GOAL_%' THEN 'TASKS' WHEN type = 'HOURS_DEADLINE' THEN 'DEADLINES' ELSE 'ACCOUNTS' END;` + `UPDATE "Notification" SET "readAt" = "createdAt" WHERE read = 1;` |
| **M5** | 6 | Drop `WebsiteFeedback` | `DROP TABLE "WebsiteFeedback";` — decision 3. Its own migration, so the cut is one reviewable commit. |
| **M6** | 7 | `Assignment.deadline → dueNote`, `+ dueOn DATETIME` | `ALTER TABLE "Assignment" RENAME COLUMN "deadline" TO "dueNote";` (already used in `20260806170000`) + `ADD COLUMN "dueOn" DATETIME`. `setMentorAllocation` stops writing `formatDate()` text into the field (`students.ts:866`). This is what makes `TASK_OVERDUE` derivable — today two past-due tasks render neutral. |
| **M7** | 7 | `NotificationPreference` | `CREATE TABLE "NotificationPreference" (userId TEXT NOT NULL, category TEXT NOT NULL, inApp BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true, email BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false, PRIMARY KEY (userId, category), FK userId→User ON DELETE CASCADE)` + seed one `WEEKLY_SUMMARY` row per user from `User.weeklyDigest`. `weeklyDigest` is kept for one release for the HMAC unsubscribe path. |
| **M8** | 8 | Drop `User.programId` | The **only** table rebuild in the plan, and it is last: `User` has an FK on `programId` so `DROP COLUMN` is refused. Create `new_User` with every column named explicitly, `INSERT … SELECT`, drop, rename, recreate indexes, inside the `defer_foreign_keys` pragmas. By this point nothing has read the column for a release. |

### 8.2 `src/lib/authz.ts` (new)

```ts
adminScope(user): Promise<"ALL" | Set<programId>>   // React-cache()d; explicit grants only
staffLevel(user, programId): Promise<"ADMIN" | "LEADER" | "SALES" | null>
requireAdminAccess(): Promise<User>                  // any non-empty scope; replaces requireRole(ADMIN)
requireProgramScope(programId): Promise<User>         // notFound() when out of scope
canManageStudent(user, profile): Promise<boolean>
canManageProgram(user, programId): Promise<boolean>
canManageMentor(user, mentorId): Promise<boolean>     // shares at least one in-scope program
mentorReaches(user, profile): Promise<boolean>        // THE one reach rule (4 copies deleted)
assertProgramScope(actor, programId): ActionResult    // for server actions
```

`mentorReaches` collapses `interviews.ts:46-74`, `sessions.ts:229-275`,
`mentor/students/[id]/page.tsx:63-109` and `admin/students/[id]/page.tsx:93-106` into one function,
and it is the definition of caseload everywhere (§6.2).

### 8.3 Gates

**11 `requireRole(ROLES.ADMIN)` call sites exist today** (9 pages + `admin/layout.tsx:15` +
`admin/programs/[id]/layout.tsx:28`). Every one becomes `requireAdminAccess()` or
`requireProgramScope(id)`. **Every new page in §6 calls its own gate at the top of the page
function**, and each of the 14 new pages is counted as a gate site in Phase 6's checklist. A
permission-branching page (the three-view `/mentors/[id]`) gates first and branches second.

The 26 `actor.role !== ROLES.ADMIN` literals in server actions become scope checks, split across
three commits by file group so the money path is never in a diff with anything else:
students/programs (12 gates), mentors/assignments (7), sessions/interviews (7). `moveStudent`
requires **both** source and target in scope, or a program admin can poach students.
`updateMentor`'s name/email edits become platform-admin-only — once admins are peers,
`mentors.ts:174-176` is an account-takeover path. `createProgram` and every `ProgramStaff` write are
platform-only; `createMentor` is allowed when every target program is in scope.

### 8.4 One write surface for admin grants

`/settings/platform` › **Program access** is the only place a grant is created, changed or removed.
`/programs/[id]/settings` › **Admins** lists the same rows **read-only** with "Manage on
Platform →". `STAFF_SEED` shrinks to the bootstrap admin and is never again the way an admin is
made. This closes the only decision-compliance wobble in the winning proposal.

### 8.5 The seed, and why it must be one commit

`render.yaml:25` runs `db:migrate:deploy && db:seed && next start` on **every boot**, and
`prisma/seed.ts:44-60` upserts `role`, `programId` and `isMentor` from config. So a config-shaped
grant list would re-grant an admin the owner had just demoted on the next hand deploy — and a
`seed.ts` still writing `programId` fails to typecheck the moment the schema drops the relation,
which does not fail a test, it **fails the boot**. Therefore **M2, `prisma/seed.ts`,
`config/app-config.ts` (STAFF_SEED → tech@ only), the `deleteProgram` guard and the schema edit are
ONE commit.** Phase 8 then removes `db:seed` from `startCommand`, since staff now live in the
database.

### 8.6 Aggregates: the rule that protects the numbers

Two pages print a scope-wide "remaining" figure (§6.1, §6.12). Forfeiture is computed **per
allocation in JS** against each row's own deadline (`queries.ts:80-100`, `hours.ts:79-88`), and
`studentsWithHours` with a `slice` totals that page only. Therefore:

- **No UI aggregate may re-derive `remaining`** — not with a SQL `groupBy`, not with a second reducer.
- One tested helper: `programTotals(programIds: string[], now: Date)` in `src/lib/hours.ts`, reusing
  `studentsWithHours` **unsliced** per program and summing its per-student results, `cache()`d once
  per request. At the designed scale (5-10 programs, 100-300 students) that is the honest cost.
- It ships with vitest coverage in the same commit — one expired allocation, one overdraw, one EXTRA.
- `totals()` (`admin/page.tsx:24-34`) and its three copy-pastes (`programs/[id]/page.tsx:117-125`,
  `program-dashboard.tsx:35-43`, `program-students-island.tsx:26-32`) are deleted in its favour.

### 8.7 Notifications

`staffIdsFor(programId)` replaces `adminIds()` (`notify.ts:72-78`) at `sessions.ts:314,647,720,783`
and `students.ts:335-338`. It returns **platform admins ∪ that program's `ProgramStaff(ADMIN)`** —
which ends the fan-out that sends every session in every program to all ten admins, nine of whom
are mentors. Two producers are added (`FEEDBACK_RECEIVED`, `WEEKLY_SUMMARY`); the correction
template stops repeating unchanged fields ("now 2 hours on August 6 (was 2 on August 6)",
`sessions.ts:637` area). `ensureDeadlineReminders()` is removed from the three page GETs and the
cron owns it.

### 8.8 The import wall, handled by design

10 of 11 Master's students have logged sessions and **zero** `HourAllocation` rows, so a naive
attention list opens with twenty near-identical red rows. Whatever the owner decides (§10 q1), the
design does not demo as broken: `AttentionList` caps at 20 and `rollUp()` collapses more than three
statuses of one type into one row:

> `× 10 students have no time allocated · Master's Program →`

That row links to `/students?program=…&preset=no-time`. This is a decision, not a workaround: a list
of twenty identical facts is one fact.

---

## 9. Phases

Every step is one commit with a real message, pushed to `main` (repo cadence). Every phase is
independently shippable: at the end of each, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`
pass, and the app is coherent. The owner deploys by hand at any phase boundary.

**The order is chosen so the noise drops first.** By the end of Phase 2 — before any route moves,
any permission changes, or any risky migration — the palette is calm, the stat strips are gone, the
washes and monograms are gone, long text is fixed system-wide, and all three homes answer their
question in three sections. Everything after that is structure.

### Phase 0 — Guard rails (3 commits)

1. `vitest` + `vitest.config.ts` + `npm test` script; first tests for `src/lib/hours.ts`
   (`allocationSummary`: forfeiture on an expired allocation, overdraw, no-show counted as used and
   missed, EXTRA excluded from every total, a voided session returning time, the ungranted-mentor
   derived row). **This is the first commit of the project and it lands before a single token
   changes** — the repo has zero test files.
2. `scripts/check-colors.mjs` + `scripts/check-copy.mjs`, wired into `npm run lint` as **warnings**.
3. `next.config.ts` `redirects()` skeleton, checked in empty, with the §2.3 policy as a comment.

*Verify:* `npm test` green; `npm run lint` prints the raw-class and banned-phrase counts (expect
106 and ~40).

### Phase 1 — Tokens, the status model, quiet chrome (13 commits)

4. `globals.css`: add `warn-*`, `danger-*` and the three identity tones; delete the 24 `tone-*`
   tokens, `log-*`/`plan-*`, `accent-ink-dark`, `accent-dark`, `accent-soft`. Add
   `src/lib/brand.ts` as the single hex source and import it in `email/layout.ts`.
5. `person-tone.ts` → 3 tones; delete `ProgramTone`, `PROGRAM_TONES`, `programTone()`,
   `personBanner()`, `PROGRAM_TONE_COUNT`. **M1** in this commit.
6. `src/lib/status.ts` + `src/lib/status.test.ts` (every type's severity, per-audience labels,
   `rollUp`, `SEVERITY_RANK`, the expiry windows).
7. `ui/status-chip.tsx`; migrate every `Chip` call site (green → `ok`/`neutral`, amber → `warn`,
   red → `danger`, violet → `neutral`); delete `chip.tsx` and `deadline.tsx`.
8. `ui/callout.tsx` → `info | warn | danger`, always with a glyph; the one-per-page ceiling.
9. `ui/section.tsx` (`PageTitle`, `Section`, `Eyebrow`) **and `ui/disclosure.tsx`** (§5.4: native
   `<details>`, count in the summary, one rotating chevron); delete `ui/panel.tsx`, `ui/page-header.tsx`,
   `ui/card.tsx`; remove the `tone` prop from 18 call sites and every wash and monogram.
10. `ui/figure.tsx`; replace all 57 `StatCard` instances; delete `stat-card.tsx`. One `lead` per page.
11. `hours-breakdown.tsx` three fills + shaped legend swatches; `hours-ring.tsx` reads
    `allocationSummary.remaining` (the disagreement dies).
12. `ui/empty-state.tsx` restructured with no `action` slot; delete the 6 inline `<p>` empties and
    the 3 raw red error paragraphs.
13. `expandable-text.tsx` applied to every free text (§5.3 item 3); `StatusChip` wrapping; the
    `min-w-0` sweep; every table capped at 6 columns.
14. `ui/link.tsx` (`ArrowLink`, `ExternalLink`); delete `telegram-handle.tsx`,
    `student-folder-link.tsx`, `arrow-link.tsx` and every `→` text glyph.
15. `programTotals()` in `hours.ts` + tests; delete `totals()` and its three copies.
16. `check-colors.mjs` and `check-copy.mjs` to **error**.

*Verify:* zero raw palette classes, zero banned phrases, `npm test`, and screenshots of
`/admin/students/[id]` and `/student` at 390px and 1280px — the two 14-hue pages now carry two
chromatic statuses plus identity.

### Phase 2 — The three homes go quiet (5 commits)

No route moves. No migrations. This is the phase the owner is waiting for.

17. `/sessions/new` as a page: re-host the existing `LogSessionForm` (no rewrite), add the
    duplicate-submit guard, value preservation, adjacent errors, the URL draft, and `ui/receipt.tsx`
    with **Correct · Log another · Back to student**.
18. `attention-list.tsx` + `timeline.tsx` (built on the status model).
19. `/mentor` → §6.2: Needs you · Up next · Your students, `mentorReaches` as the caseload, the
    embedded forms and the six lifetime figures deleted.
20. `/admin` → §6.1: Needs you (with inline **Approve**) · Up next · Programs rows · Recent, the
    stat strip and editable log deleted.
21. `/student` → §6.3: ring beside the `h1`, Needs you with the inline meeting answer, Up next,
    Your time, Working on, Latest change; `StudentJourney` and `MentorHoursList` unmounted from the
    home (they still exist; they get their new homes in Phase 6/7).

*Verify:* sign in as admin, dual admin (both lenses), plain mentor, student; screenshot each home
at 390px and 1280px; confirm `/student`'s first "Needs you" row starts above 420px at 390×664.

### Phase 3 — Permissions and program scope (7 commits)

22. **M2 + `prisma/schema.prisma` + `prisma/seed.ts` + `config/app-config.ts` (STAFF_SEED → tech@
    only) + the `deleteProgram` staff guard, in ONE commit** (§8.5).
23. `src/lib/authz.ts` + `src/lib/authz.test.ts`.
24. Re-gate pages: 11 `requireRole(ROLES.ADMIN)` sites → `requireAdminAccess()` /
    `requireProgramScope()`.
25. Re-gate actions, group 1: `students.ts`, `programs.ts` (12 gates, `moveStudent` both-sides).
26. Re-gate actions, group 2: `mentors.ts`, `assignments.ts` (7 gates; name/email edits become
    platform-only).
27. Re-gate actions, group 3: `sessions.ts`, `interviews.ts` (7 gates; the money path alone in its
    own diff, with `hours.test.ts` green).
28. `staffIdsFor()` replaces `adminIds()`; delete `/leader/**`, `/sales/**`,
    `program-dashboard.tsx`, `program-students-island.tsx`.

*Verify:* `npm test`; sign in as platform admin, a one-program admin, dual admin, plain mentor,
student; an out-of-scope student page 404s and an out-of-scope action returns its error; running
`npm run db:seed` twice does not re-grant a demoted admin.

### Phase 4 — Shell and lens (4 commits)

29. `profile` cookie + `setProfile()` server action; `/` becomes a server `redirect()`;
    `homeFor(user, profile)`.
30. `ui/segmented.tsx` + `ui/popover.tsx`; `ProfileSwitch` rebuilt on them (visible, `brand-soft`,
    ⌥M guards kept from `profile-switch.tsx:80-119`); delete `profile-switch.tsx`, `nav-links.tsx`,
    `RoleBadge`.
31. `sidebar.tsx` + `tab-bar.tsx` + the utility cluster (bell count in `brand`, labelled gear,
    account menu, student search); `navFor(viewer, profile)` replaces `NAV_BY_ROLE`; `max-w-6xl`.
32. One `error.tsx` per shell (7 → 2); `PublicShell` for `/login`, `/unsubscribe` and onboarding;
    the minimal shell while PENDING or UNASSIGNED.

*Verify:* ⌥M on a student page keeps the URL and removes no control; the bell and a mentor page no
longer flip the nav to Admin; 390px and 1280px screenshots of both shells.

### Phase 5 — Shared renderers (6 commits)

Each commit replaces its whole cluster and rewrites its call sites.

33. `session-row.tsx` (`SessionRow`, `SessionsTable`); delete `meetings-log.tsx`,
    `student-journey.tsx` and the `/mentor/sessions` inline table.
34. `task-row.tsx` (`TaskRow`, `TaskTable`); one progress map; delete `assignments-panel.tsx`,
    `student-goals.tsx`.
35. `allocation-row.tsx` (fixes the `2h 30m h left` double unit); delete `mentor-hours-list.tsx`.
36. `ui/filter-bar.tsx` from `SearchForm` + `MentorHoursFilter` (URL → Prisma `where`) +
    `src/lib/filters.test.ts`; delete `ui/search-form.tsx`, `mentor-hours-filter.tsx`.
37. `ui/row-action-menu.tsx` + `ui/confirm-inline.tsx`; rebuild the 4 popovers and the 8 confirms;
    delete `forms/remove-assignment-button.tsx`; the four `*-row-actions.tsx` files fold into
    `forms/session-forms.tsx`, `forms/meeting-forms.tsx` and `forms/hours-forms.tsx`.
38. `person-cell` in `person-chip.tsx`, `ui/settings-row.tsx`, `ui/save-state.tsx`
    (+ `useUnsavedChanges`), `ui/fact-list.tsx`; delete `forms/action-feedback.tsx`.

*Verify:* every session, task and allocation renders through one component (grep for the deleted
names returns nothing); `npm test`; a keyboard-only pass over a row menu and a confirm.

### Phase 6 — Role-neutral routes and destinations (9 commits)

39. The `next.config.ts` redirect map filled in **plus** role-neutral hrefs from every producer
    (`notify.ts:81-90`) **plus** the `/n/[id]` handler — one commit, so no link ever points at a
    route that does not exist yet. No stored rows are rewritten.
40. `/students` (FilterBar, 6 columns, presets, pagination) and `/programs/[id]/students`.
41. `/students/[id]` — the workspace (§6.7); delete `ledger-board.tsx`, `student-ledger.tsx`,
    `forms/student-corrections.tsx`, `forms/student-folder-form.tsx`, and both old student pages.
42. `/sessions` with both tabs (the TODO-batch-1 admin ledger) and the `MeetingsLog` mounts on six
    surfaces removed.
43. `/mentors` (`mentors-table.tsx`) and `/mentors/[id]` (three views); delete
    `forms/mentor-list.tsx`, `forms/create-mentor-form.tsx`.
44. `/programs` + `/programs/[id]` overview with `cache()`d shared reads; delete
    `program-island-card.tsx`, `program-tabs.tsx` (→ `TabLinks`).
45. `/programs/[id]/settings` + **M3** (`status`, `archivedAt`, `tracksPayment`) + `archiveProgram`;
    the `MASTERS_PROGRAM_NAME` match retired at all four sites.
46. `/feedback` (one page, three shapes, lowest-average-first, the leak closed, the N+1 collapsed) +
    **M5**; delete `mentor-feedback-list.tsx` and the website form.
47. `/notifications` + **M4** (category, readAt) + the category filter + `FEEDBACK_RECEIVED` and
    `WEEKLY_SUMMARY` producers.

*Verify:* every route in §2.1 resolves or 308s; a stored notification href from before the change
still lands correctly; screenshots of `/students/[id]`, `/sessions`, `/programs/[id]` at both widths.

### Phase 7 — Settings, platform, student app (6 commits)

48. `/settings` (profile for every role — the `canActAsMentor` gate lifted; Telegram; booking links
    out of the mentor home and the mentor page; the digest toggle out of the feed).
49. `/settings/platform` with the `GrantsEditor` as the sole grant write surface, the Programs
    section, and the read-only Organisation facts.
50. **M7** + the per-category notification matrix; `weekly-digest.ts` and both unsubscribe paths
    read the `WEEKLY_SUMMARY` row.
51. `/onboarding` (all four branches, including the PENDING step moved off `/student`); delete both
    old onboarding routes and `forms/onboarding-form.tsx`, `forms/mentor-profile-form.tsx`,
    `forms/own-name-form.tsx`, `forms/avatar-form.tsx` (its crop pipeline moves into
    `forms/profile-forms.tsx` unchanged).
52. `/student/meetings` (Coming up + Past sessions, paginated) and `/student/book` (§6.5, the email
    fallback, hidden non-mentors) and `/student/feedback` (§6.6).
53. **M6** (`dueNote` + `dueOn`) + `TASK_OVERDUE` live + `setMentorAllocation` writing a real date;
    `ensureDeadlineReminders` removed from the three page GETs; the `Asia/Tashkent` bucket fix and
    the zone label.

*Verify:* a student on a phone can answer a meeting, book, and rate a mentor; a mentor sets a
booking link and watches the inbox row disappear.

### Phase 8 — Copy, docs, cleanup, verification (6 commits)

54. Copy sweep against §5.6 — every grammar bug in the audit list ("Your mentoring time are all
    used up", "before your time appear", "Your time with them run to", "Extra — none of your used",
    "45 min unused minutes", the comma splice on `admin/page.tsx:79`), `formatDate` everywhere, one
    product name, `programContact()` wired.
55. Brand assets: `public/brand/` (favicon, apple-touch-icon, `logo.svg`), the five Next.js starter
    SVGs deleted, `docs/guides/generate-guides.cjs` importing `src/lib/brand.ts`.
56. `DESIGN.md` rewritten (Color, Components, the two rules from §1); `PRODUCT.md`'s orange line;
    `README.md`'s roles table; `AGENTS.md` gains the page-level-gate rule; `TODO.md` rewritten;
    `UX-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` marked superseded by this file.
57. Delete the redirect map (one release after Phase 6) and the `db:seed` step from
    `render.yaml`'s `startCommand`.
58. **M8** — the `User` rebuild that drops `programId`.
59. **Verification pass.** `npm run lint`; `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npm run build`; `npm test`. Then per
    `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`, sign in as **platform admin, program admin, dual admin in
    BOTH lenses, plain mentor, and student**, and capture screenshots at **390px and 1280px** of
    `/admin`, `/mentor`, `/students/[id]`, `/students`, `/sessions`, `/sessions/new`,
    `/programs/[id]`, `/programs/[id]/settings`, `/student`, `/student/meetings`, `/student/book`,
    `/notifications`, `/settings`. Run **keyboard-only** through *Log a session* and *Approve a
    student*. Confirm: no table scrolls sideways at 390px; no page shows two chromatic status hues
    other than warn and danger; every free text clamps with a working "Show more"; reduced-motion
    zeroes the staggered delays. **The audit produced zero rendered evidence at any viewport — this
    is the first time the owner's "long text not rendering right" is actually observed.**

---

## 10. Owner decisions — answered 2026-09-03

All six are settled. Where the answer differs from the recommendation above it, the owner's answer
governs and the reason it is safe is stated.

1. **Imported Master's data — LEAVE IT AS IT IS.** No backfill, no EXTRA re-marking, no new state,
   no wipe. The Master's ledger keeps reading `-20h 2m still to deliver` and `83h 2m of 65h
   completed`, and 10 of 11 students keep the `BALANCE_NONE` + `BALANCE_OVERDRAWN` statuses their
   rows honestly earn. This is survivable precisely because of §5.1 `rollUp()`: more than three
   statuses of one type collapse to a single row (`"10 students have no time allocated →"`), so the
   first screen stays calm without anyone inventing a balance. Do NOT add a special case for
   imported rows anywhere; the honest-ledger principle is doing its job.
2. **Money — every admin, everywhere it appears today.** Keep the figure on the admin dashboard,
   the program overview and the student page as well as on allocation rows and program settings. It
   still moves behind `Program.tracksPayment` (M3) rather than the `MASTERS_PROGRAM_NAME` string
   match, so renaming a program stops silently disabling billing. No SALES-only view is built.
3. **tech@ as a student-facing mentor — keep as is.** `tech@` stays `isMentor: true` and remains
   bookable. Note that two of the three symptoms disappear anyway: the `"Hi, Freshman"` greeting
   goes when Phase 2 deletes the greeting banner (`mentor/page.tsx:404-415`), and `/student/book`
   stops offering mentors with no allocation and no booking link (Phase 7). What remains by choice
   is the organisation's name owning ledger rows and appearing in the feedback picker.
4. **Platform admin — tech@ only.** Step 22's seed marks exactly one account. The accepted risk is
   that a lockout freezes program creation and grant-making; the escape hatch is one statement in
   the Render shell (`UPDATE "User" SET "platformAdmin" = true WHERE email = '…';`), which is why a
   second address is not required. Do not widen this without asking.
5. **DEPT_LEADER and SALES — keep as `ProgramStaff` levels with exactly today's powers.** Read the
   program, add students, and for LEADER see that program's feedback. No approving signups, no
   allocating time. Add nothing until a real person holds the role.
6. **Nothing else is cut.** Mentor ratings and the weekly digest email both stay, as specified.
   `WebsiteFeedback` remains the only removal (M5).

## 11. Out of scope (the post-redesign list)

Not in this plan, deliberately, and each for a stated reason. Do not fold them in.

- **`TaskType` table + `Assignment.taskTypeId`** — SQLite cannot `ADD COLUMN` with a foreign key, so
  it is a full rebuild of `Assignment`, whose rows live sessions point at. `TaskPicker` reading
  `TASK_PRESETS` loses the user nothing. Its own commit, later, behind a Platform section.
- **`Session.attendance` column** replacing `attended`/`late`/`RESCHEDULED`-in-status — it rewrites
  columns the ledger reads.
- **`MentorAssignment.calendlyUrl → bookingUrl`** and **`Interview.kind`** — naming hygiene with a
  migration attached.
- **Cohort dates and status**, `HourAllocation.source`, `ReminderLog`, the `Feedback` table merge.
- **A mentor Telegram field.** The email fallback in §6.5 works today with no schema change. If
  students should reach mentors on Telegram, that is a `User` column plus a `/settings` row.
- **Per-user time zones.** The stored wall-clock plus a "Tashkent" label is the smallest honest fix.
- **Saved views as a persistence model** — URL presets only, per the brief.
- **A staff-management system beyond grants** — the brief forbids it, and §8.4 is the minimum
  decision 1 requires.
